i bought this to use with my keyboard. i wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. it doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what i'd always used. doesn't have the same feel either. nowhere close.in my opinion, a sustain pedal like the m-audio sp-2 sustain pedal with piano style action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. the price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. the only thing i've found the yamaha fc-5 sustain pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where i keep my electric guitar pedals. 
i didn't expect this cable to be so thin. it's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable i've used. not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference. if i had the foresight i'd sp couple extra bucks on a thicker cable. still, it works and was inexpensive.edit: 6 months later and it's dead already. wire frayed at the right angle jack. you get what you pay for. 
it hums, crackles, and i think i'm having problems with my equipment. as soon as i use any of my other cords then the problem is gone. hosa makes some other products that have good value. but based on my experience i don't recommhis one. 
i'm a pro-cheapo and i hated this thing. they're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. drop few more bucks and get something else! 
i bought this for my canon vixia hf g10 video camera and a shotgun mic that i recently purchased for it. i needed a 12&#34; wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic (which is mounted on the mini advanced shoe) to the microphone plug on the video camera...the wire on this thing is not 1 foot long. the actual wire is under 8&#34; long itself. i would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... i'd have rated it 1 star, but i tried it on my nikon d3200 (shoe mounted shotgun mike) and it worked out ok. still a tight fit though (since there's only 8&#34; of wire)...i'd recommnyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.also, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but i hear a hiss when recording. again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the dslr or not (or my shotgun mic). 
i got 3 of these to plug xlr cables into the 1/4&#34; jacks on my board. i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs. none of them work. perhaps i got the wrong thing? 
received it in time, standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days. since i was out of 30 days return time, sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today. 
these things are terrible. one wouldn't fit in my soundboard, another wouldn't lock in my mic. plain and simple....if your looking for crap that doesn't work....buy this. 
the handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and i feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. it's cheap and easy to use. it'll do the job, but i don't like it. 
it's good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price 
the epiphone les paul guitars don't particularly sound that great, but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price. if your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar, but you're not completely sure if they will stick with it, if you can spnother $100 and get a used mexican made f strat or tele. the reason for this is because for 1, if they decide it's not something they want to do anymore, you can resell it at the same price you bought it for (as long as it is still in decent condition) and little no money is lost. second, if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a &#34;better&#34; or more high uitar, mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. i have a couple different high uitars and i will not get rid of my mexy strat because it sounds great still. i'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this. 
this is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, you want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it. why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me. this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hx would use. boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.these things are built with heavy metal, it should last, i kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion 
from greg abrams review, entitled review is to give newer players some information. you have plenty of options for distortion pedals, the ds-1 is not the only thing out there that's affordable. find something you truly love and buy that. if its the ds-1, one of the pedals i've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to you. 
here's the deal with this pedal. it is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. in my opinion, for spg less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the mxr badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it. 
if you want your guitar to sound like eddie van halen, joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a boss gt-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. search google for boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. 
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg. all the other guitars i own have schaller buttons on them and i have one main strap i use for all of the guitars. i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out. not twenty min later i was removing them and putting schaller buttons in their place. here the 3 major reasons i did not like them over schaller:1- bulky. they stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- problems engaging. i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. it wasn't until i forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- cheap. they just feel cheap. thin metal is used in comparison to the schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.for a few bucks more i'll stick with schaller's. i have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail. 
. once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. so if you are stuck with a set, here's what i recommo to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1\" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (they are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)put the screw into an electric drill (pointy n) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. it doesn't need much. i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. while you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.install with the new screws as normal, and recommhat your fritry a different brand! 
sorry, i don't like these as they're just too big. they stand out too much. they do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. there are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap. again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. i also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like i should be wearing big purple platforms when i play. not cool. 
the thing is that they don't seem to stay! i mean, you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic &#34;arm&#34;, but it doesn't stay where you put it. and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality. but, i think if you're lucky if just might get the job done. 
i purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. i would have returned it but i completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed). 
wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is much better...avoid this!! 
i ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? i ordered it \"new,\" and it definitely shows signs that it not new. first, the package was stapled, that's right- stapled together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. when i order something new, i expect it to be new. based on this product alone, i would not recommuying from this seller. 
well, what can i say? based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. however, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. the cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). and before you ask, &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;, all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. so it is definitely the cable :(anyway, i gave it 2 stars because while it was working it sounded great through my roland jc120. 
as the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. if you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. i purchased it for that reason...and i'm an adult, so i can be careful. this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. it will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.there are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason i gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price. 
i got this for my boss loop station, but it doesn't work very well. i keep hoping i'll find something it does work well with... 
that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. i bought the .90 gauge at guitar center and love them. these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound. i don't know if i will use these forever but for right now i love them. just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.buy em!!!! 
long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. so when my strings wear out, i got this. now i feel like playing an emg bridge on my f/archtop's neck position, without the power that an emg pickup has to offer. yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like seagulls...bottom line, i recommhis string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. if you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string. 
i've been playing guitar for over 40 years, and these tortex picks are nearly the worst i'v ever used. they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity-clack noise. dunlop ultex picks sound much better. 
i can't hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them. better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast 
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase. 
to a great brand like dunlop. let's hope this is just a short-term fluke. 
it's simple, basic, but i don't think it does that good of a job. this is because it doesn't really humidify that much and doesn't extery far into the guitar. 
this product is not what it seems. it has a cool name, but that's about it. it's a tool oil that stinks. i tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. after doing away with the fast-fret, my playing has improved and i hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. i now use old english and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. you will too... 
not a great mic, but if you need something realitively cheap, it'll do. limited dynamic range. but, it works. wish i'd have gotten something a little nicer though. 
it just randomly pops off my bass, it's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down. i hate it. 
years ago i used the clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. i couldn't tell from the picture, that these were full size, and i didn't check the size in the description. i still had a few of the small ones, so i used them as templates, to cut these down. i would have rated them higher, if i could have used them as is. it's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. i purchased two six packs of clayton teardrop picks, but found dunlop 423r60 0.60mm (orange) tortex small tear drop guitar picks, 36-pack which are a lot cheaper. 
this is a basic eq pedal, that is a bit noisy in my testing. even when running on battery power, there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs. 
i don't like the feel or sound of these strings. i bought both the 10 and the 11 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil. i would not buy these again 
it is not the size for mini guitar. may be for the big one...connections are shaky. you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low. 
total flimsy junk. it leans wayyy too far back. i'll be damned if i put my $1000 guitars on these things. on the other hand, chromacast makes one that's very close to this price, and i doubt that it could have been more for the money i paid.in summary... do not BUY this piece of junk. 
...for something, but not a guitar. wasn't sure what to do with it so i now use it to mount a large cookbook, or notepad computer, so i can follow a recipe. it seems to work okay for that. just don't use this for guitars. an electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far, and the arms have no grip. this thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project. it may even give you aids! but probably not. however, animals could have been harmed in the making. but most likely, and in reality, it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner. 
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder. thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par. you'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips. 
the wire clipper and winder work o.k., but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn't slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out. bad design by someone who doesn't use it to pull pins out of a bridge. i p using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out. i've done it successfully for years. 
header says it all. works well enough as a string winder, but i was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me, this did not work well at all. went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle. 
i honestly really didn't find this thing useful at all. first, the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesn't open easily (very stiff action), so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick. and as for the winder... i suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. but it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything i used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help. didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing. just looked at it... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.each time i have set out to use it, i p turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string. i just recently  up buying a set of crescent brand miniature cutters & needle-nose pliers set(the pliers are just the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding). when i have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar, i'll try the notch bridge peg puller. but other wise, this thing gets a serious two-star &#34;meh&#34;. 
i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recomm at the music store. put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic 12 string. have 2 problems with the strings. first, the bass e (11th string) broke while tuning it up. had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not elixir). i have changed strings many, many times, so i am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the e string itself. second, the high D (8th string) seems \"dead\"; it does not \"ring\" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets i've used). considering these strings cost much more than others, i certainly am disappointed in them. hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good. 
i bought a set as they were recomm to get the tone i was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. installed as usual and tuned them. they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. my capo could not even hold them. i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. when i looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. i released the tension on all the strings as fast as i could and left it. i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. use at your own risk!!!!!!! i personally wouldn't give a nickel for them. 
not two weeks after i put these on the a string broke close to the ball on the string. i break high e strings on occasion. but something as thick as an a string?? maybe it was a defective string as i thankfully bought two sets and i was able to pull the a out of the other set and it has been fine since. now however i have the dilemma of should i just buy more strings and just use the second set as i need them. further more do i stick with the same brand. that is supposed to last longer than average strings. at this point i am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there. i will update once i decide if i should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky'supdate 3/25well another month went by(a week ago) and the d string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe i either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be. either way its losing another star. if it happens with a different set of strings i will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly 
i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic, which i was pretty happy with. for my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn't have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings. i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and i was right. i put a pair of d'addario xl 9.5 (highly recomm for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings. i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently. don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of d'addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings. 
looked like the chrome was cheesey and they  up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position 
did not hold the strings down very well for me... i love the feel of it, but the spring needs more power. 
this is an update to my original review because i have now fully tested two of these capos. i'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here. i'm not sure how it's possible. i've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim dunlop capos. i had purchased two, which i have now given away to student players as i cannot use them. i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar. the e string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. both capos had this very same problem.when i received these capos, i noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual jim dunlop capos. the craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official jim dunlop capos. the rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product. as a professional musician, i need to purchase reputable brand-name products because i can't afford to have my gear failing during performances. i have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation. when i contacted the seller, they were not honest with me. 
i know many people love the design, but i find it much too frustrating. you have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly, then snap it in, then turn and turn the screw, oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw. then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again. what a farce. this is the worst capo i've owned, and i've tried nearly every brand and type. yeah, i've had people show me how to do it right, and i know to do it right. it's just wrong to have to spo much time slipping it on, snapping it, screwing it in, screwing it off, having it fall off, forget it, it's garbage to me. also, while i'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day, the last thing i want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw. it's actually slightly painful to the fingers (momentarily, but why have to deal with that??) to work with. this design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it. the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable.no thanks. 
i bought this hoping to use as int, angled into guitar & straight into mixer, wrong, have to use it the other way around ... sad! 
only lasted 2yr. i have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it. 
could not get to fit small sound hole. once in sound hole pickup did not work at all. would not buy it. 
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. one was in the skb f case ($99.95 on amazon), the other in this gator case purchased locally. i was told it was just as good as the f case. both  up in checked luggage. after 1 flight from florida to lax and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up. the padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case. neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, i just ordered another skb f case. the gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips. the skb fs will be my airline cases from now on. 
i don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school. when you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.it'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. i just don't like the features of this stand at all. 
i've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting. this one is the worst. the plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle. bad...just bad.secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp. it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement. after twisting on it twice i stripped it out. now the thing is worthless. i'm returning it asap.i would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing. do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6\" pop filter. if you don't, you'll wish you did. 
not happy with the sellers description or the product. the description says \"heavy duty\" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic mic clip, but it's not. it's rubber!!! it sucks. used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and i can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. it's flexible!!! who uses flexible mic clips?!!! make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead. 
its poorly made with attention to detail. i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon. but they will not screw down all the way and are losse. it is useless!!! other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine. 
just assembly for a try, only few rolls with music, it's had some hole on head, that's mean bad quality. buyer beware for this kind of. 
not so pleased with the sound quality..sorta disappointed with it over all...but ya get what ya pay for ....so i'll keep it anyway 
crap these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bunless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of ernies i didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again 
i've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. mainly due to the low cost. they work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. the guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go \"flat\" sounding. these are not quality strings at all, just cheap chinese made quality. they are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. better strings are worth the extra cost. you actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. i've had this problem with all the d'addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. the tarnish and corrosion often up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster. 
i have played on d'addario before, actually the first string i started out on.super light's are ok, but can wear out real fast, so, it's importent not to put to much stess on them.....espescially if you do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme b, etc they will break. any skilled guitarist know's to use extream caution when tuning....any strings,i did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them) i would not recamhese for beginer's, cause beginer's to press hard, when they first stat out.personally, i don't like d'addario's at all, i find the tone to bright. 
far too slippery for my fingers when i shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well. 
this piece of plastic is just terrible. you'd be better off with a couple of books and a towel.not recomm! 
go build your own. build it to your specs and have a solid stand. if not, you can find a lot better head stands. this one was a huge disappointment. does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick. im back with my wood block and am happy. 
i might have done something wrong...i read in a review that these hold six picks.it held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart...i'll just keep using my pockets. 
man, this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks! do not BUY - it is a wast of money... ug! 
i use clayton 1.26mm picks, a heavy pick but certainly not oversized. my picks don't fit!!! if i shove them in, i can't get them out. also, this thing is huge for the back of the neck. 
my picks fall out way too easy while i'm playing live 
dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the near the plugs detirorate quickly. will never buy again even if only 5 bucks 
second one i bought. lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months. went through two of these before i learned my lesson. don't waste your money on this junk. i love planet waves stuff normally, but these are junk. 
i got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is no CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world....after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead,,, 
this was bought based on the advice of others. i had a cable with the standard neutrik/switchcraft-type fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.it worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. it happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that i swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. after confirming the guitar was okay, i tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.d'addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. you also have to get r.a. taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. the extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. in my case, i bit the bullet and did what i should have done the first go-round and got a really nice dimarzio cable.again, this cable sounds good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. the good news is that imo high price is not a guarantee of any cable sounding good. the replacement dimarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. i don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but i want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. this one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.so the replacement that planet waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. i figure i'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. if i have a few $ for the shipping and d'addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, i may get it replaced. more likely i will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - imo it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.if this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, i'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. and if d'addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. idk how much r&d; it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what i would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. that would not make it a deal breaker. 
well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks. bought a new f mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago. last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. messed around a bit and it started to work. today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp. thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy. got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either. at least my new amp is working and i only have to replace a $12 cord.maybe i'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if i bought it at a local store i'd return it. not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund. will just move on to another company's cord. 
the cable died on me in less than a month. very disappointed in built quality. 
these look so neat that my brother and i both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last christmas. unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play. 
i purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. i was disapointed when i mounted a shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. they may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. it would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. i wasted my money. don't waste yours. perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-) 
nice looking gooseneck, threads are clean, fits well. however, the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic (shure sm58) without collapsing. better try another brand, or sp buck or two more to get a better product. 
this arrived and when i tried to use it, it turned out that the male threads were some oddball metric size that does not fit any standard adapter.instead, these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip, so now i have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck and a clip.this is such a standard item, that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads, and no excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths... 
i have several mxr pedals. every one is superb--except for this phase 90 (the non- review ed here). this phase 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. i did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (look up \"mxr phase 90 mods,\" and \"erik's corner\" will show you how.) i made the \"r28,\" \"c11,\" and \"c12\" modifications. the result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. finally, i tried adjusting the internal trim pot. on no setting could i get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. i spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. no luck. bottom line: if you want a phaser that doesn't add significant distortion, avoid this incarnation of the phase 90. 
okay, color coding is a great idea.divas will not use the red ball windscreen.why?because, from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose.no kidding! i have had several tell this to me and my sound tech. so save your dough, buy any color but red.diva's!!!! what can i say? 
i bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a gls mic and it doesn't fit either. a little too small. 
yes you can tweak it so its less, but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable. 
do not use these to polish your guitar. it leaves tons of small fibers all over, and is hard to clean up. a total disaster. these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop, but not cleaning anything. 
not very substantial. it began to tear on my guitar strings. i was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses. 
this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy! you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit.i'm not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either- there are a lot of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable.over all i would not recommhis product. 
compression/sustain wise, this unit is decent but i cannot abide the noise ... i tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor ... 
if you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a guitar > volume pedal > amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a poorly engineered pedal. it can't be review .)it does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (not \"true bypass\" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal. i will need to try that out, but it does not excuse ernie ball from their responsibility. major fail on their part.2 stars is generous because eb fails to honor the simple \"first do no harm\" principle. it harms your tone. how dumb is that? the pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though i have my doubts about their \"string\" mechanism over time. the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.i have no recommions for a volume pedal. because of the feel, and esthetics, i do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver. 
if you are looking for a 100% leather mandolin strap, consider another strap. the outside surface of the planet waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man-made material glued to the thin leather part. i will be ordering the levys \"leather mandolin strap (walnut)\". 
i started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked, but when i tried to add a second/third stomp box, i couldn't get any guitar sound only a loud buzz. i returned this product i did further testing, i would not recommt to anyone. with my personal experience in mind, i would advise you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply. hope this helps 
i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar. my first cheap cord wasn't actually broken, but i didn't want any down time, so i had this just sitting there as a replacement. fast forward some time, and i just wanted to try it out. even though my cheap cord was still working fine, i really wanted to just try out the new cord.i really wish i had done that in the first 30 days. this cord did not work right at all. it seems like there is a short in it somewhere. i had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. of course since it is for guitar, it falls almost immediately out of place again. so, i am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed, unlike this brand new bad cable. 
through my ampeg bass amp, the low E string gets distorted when you push the bass control above 7, and the upper 3 strings sound kind of plain. 
my guitar originally came with d'addrio exp and they sounded good. i replaced them with elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. this time i got a 3 pack of ej16-3d light. the were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.but the sound is the problem. it's terrible. they sound very muddy. crisp tone distinction is just not there. i thought light would be the better route, but now i'm not sure. i purchased some others to try. also, since a purchased a 3 pack. i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings. 
bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand. mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges. the strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks i didn't like. tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes. g-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\\ 
the small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball hile tuning. i haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball uckily i bought the three pack.but i can't recommhis product. 
d'addario,what's up? these didn't last long at all.i don't play my martin very often,(too busy with electrics..) but these were trashed in a month.guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now? never purchase again. 
this is a beautiful shock mount. however for the price it didnt perform. the mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on p's and s's. not worth the price. 
i was not happy with the sound of these strings. the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny. for an extra $2 i bought the d'addario ej45 pro arte and got a much, much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old yamaha g-60. sphe extra $2 its well worth it. 
i tried the dean markley blue steel light accoustic strings on my takamine guitar, and will soon replace them. on quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar. string did not break as i rather expected, but it looks bad. on sound, these seemed okay at first, but i still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and e steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me. and i find the low E wound string notes to be too high as i move up the neck, more so than other sets i have used.guess i'll go back to d'addario and ernie ball. 
if you expect to get what you pay for, prepare to be disappointed. sounds weak. sounds old. sounds worn. sounds dull. i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster. i can afford to pay twice as much. but i am going to keep using my d'adario strings from now on. i am so disappointed. these strings are for the &#34;campfire guitarist&#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling, tapping, pull offs, or sweepers. if you are a tone fanatic keep looking. if your guitar deserves the best, do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. respect your guitar. i wouldn't be surprised if they are made from china. 
i thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings, they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret. 
i bought one of these in the beginning - just to have something - as this is better than having nothing at all - but it's certainly nothing special. the material and the skinny width was uncomfortable for me and exacerbated my neck pain, so i only used it for a very short time.on the other hand, if you have a nice guitar that you really take great care of, then you'll probably want to invest in a much nicer strap at some point. i upgraded to a really nice 3&#34; wide black leather levy's guitar strap - which is five stars all the way.if you're a newbie and don't have a strap, and are on a tight budget and need something, then this planet waves strap will probably work for you - till you can upgrade to something nicer and more comfortable to wear. just my 2 cents. 
i have a taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar. rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap. plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since i had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where i liked it to play. if the nylon is not a problem for you and the fit over your guitar this strap is very well made. 
s, i feel i got a different product, as it didn't fit the descriptions given by others. i ordered two of these, and both were very thin material, not sturdy at all. second, both straps were not adjustable to 59&#34;. both mine measured 45&#34; from strap button hole to strap button hole, fully-ext. they are useless to me, as my guitar, a dreadnought, covers the middle of my chest when i put it on. i believe i was given a substitute product, since when i ordered these straps, the price was just $1 0, and now they're back up to $4.95 as i write this. i'm really sick of these amazon substitutions. for what i paid, i won't bother returning them...not worth the hassle. i will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars. very disappointed. warning...if you see a price drop below $4.95, don't buy...it's probably not the product that's described here. 
good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice.this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought. i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by. over the 6 months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic i recently got and it keeps popping off. this is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house. the guitar could take that head dive of death, while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse.my advice: unless you plan to sit and play (which you wont really need a strap anyways) the whole time, splittle more to get a leather strap. spg more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play. 
i really wanted this to work, but it doesn't. don't bother,it doesn't mute the strings at all. one star, just for it getting here on time. 
i bought a glaesel bridge & this glaesel rubber mute together. i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews. the mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works very well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing. there is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on. also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.if you want or need a mute for practicing quietly (as many of us do), i suggest you buy something else. this item does not work and is a total waste of money. i tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new electric violin bought here on amazon (fyi, that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item! just make sure you buythe original peg drops by ardsley& aglaesel self-adjusting 4/4 violin bridge mediumwith it!).i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all. it does not mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way. 
pedal is not working, it just making noise. poor quality control.actually it looks like used pedal, not like new.don't recommhis product. 
all i gotta say about this product is that i get a volume/tone loss when it's plugged; that is a very big problem for me. other than that is very well built, but the fact that it decreases my volume is a major issue for me. 
the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position..., but i stand in front of a mic on stage. the pedal generates a lot of &#34;noise&#34; so i can't use it. you get what you pay for. king vox and dunlop high Gain, both passive, have passed the test, and i'm pretty picky! 
i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control 2. when i got it, i tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and yes it does suck the tone right out of the signal. as far as a cv controler? it sucks at that too! why? it squeaks as you move it (after 5 minutes use, right out of the box). behringer is a joke and gives german engineering a bad name (although only 'conceived' in germany).it's a direct copy of the yamaha fc9 and so i am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares. i'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it.also, you may say \"who cares if it squeaks a little\"? well i do when i am controlling volume swells or a 'wah' effect at low volume in the studio!good luck if you buy it. 
first.the photo shows no ON/OFF switch, however this does not catch any attention.and all seller seems to have trouble to say \"this product does not have this, does not have that...\" it only says what the product does have.oh well, i got stuck with two microphones without on/off switch.i can buy an adapter with on/off switch for microphone. 
pretty disappointed in the color. as the review title indicates, what i received is more of a 'black chrome' or dingy stainless color. these are simply not going to work with the mots pickguard i purchased them for. perhaps they would bln better on a black, black pearl or tort pickguard.i ordered another package from another v and got the same result. perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is 'bad'. some are very dull looking. very disappointing, really. 
i can't believe these were actually sent to me. the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened. they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china. i am sg them back. there is no way i would use these. any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive. i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from f and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost. 
i was a little disappointed. don't know if it's a qc problem or if i just got some rejects but out of 6 pots, 1 was out of spec (315k) and 2 were almost out (289k, 205k). 1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10%. they are ctl's so i'm a bit confused. other than that they work fine, they have the nut, washer and cap included (no knob). i will be upgrading the caps. 
this pickguard was used. it not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before. 
i would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a squier bullet strat, but the holes didn't line up, it didn't fit between the neck and the bridge, in fact, it was completely wrong. nice quality though. 
bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat. doesn't fit perfect. kinda bummed but oh well 
buttons itself are fine, however when i was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar (right above the thread). and i even pre-drill it. there is no way i can get it out :( so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it (now slightly off-center now) 
need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) i have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently i needed and ordered some and i found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). guess these are too cheap for f to have qc on.will try other brands next time. 
i've ordered two of these kits in the aged white, and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate. literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor, accidentally stepped on them, and then decided they were good enough to sut for sale. the knobs, covers and tips are all in great shape, however. 
unless you guys are receiving something i am not, how can you give this anything more than one star. my backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my f stratocaster. this is inexcusable. all the other f backplates i have have enough lip to cover the route, but not this mint green one. i simply cannot understand what f is thinking. i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from f and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost. 
my first desk mic stand, and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use. it worked once when i originally set it, then kaput. it's never worked properly since. i still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it's at the right height. i would not purchase this product again. 
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings. these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string to break before they even get tuned to pitch, ernie ball strings are garbage, the only time i will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are sed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh, you can sp$ for a set of ernie ball or d'addario every 2 days or you can sp7 for a set of dr strings and change them once a month, or you can sp0$ for a set of elixir polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months, it doesn't make sense to use these crappy ernie's unless you are sponsored by eb and have an ss supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars, 
it is ok, but it does not compare to the ergo holder.which you may find here:dunlop ergo pickholder.the main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out, and it is extremely fragile. 
i bought one of each soft, medium and hard wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the hard is as soft as the soft. they felt exactly the same in fact. the medium was the hardest out of the bunch.packaging error? i have no idea. the fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. so check with what you get.sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.there is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that i do not think it is idea for strumming.the only reason i can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead. 
s i read stated that these were like rigid picks, but no they are not. too bad as i had high hopes.Good picks if you don't have to tremolo pick, not very good if do have to. 
s carefully - it's definitely something different, but not sturdy at all, rubber bits come off as you strum, and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers. ouch! i'm much happier with my friday the 13th glow-in-the-dark picks - that is an experiment that worked!and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway? if you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming, why don't you use&#8230; your fingers? 
these picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar. i don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. big disappointment. i'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. back to the drawing board i go. 
on the music stand. that comes with a solid extension arm... 
ok, it was cheap (nine bucks at the time), the design looked good and sensible, and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need. i bought it without hesitation. however(!), once hooked up, i was very surprised how flimsy it is. i have a 13\" gooseneck, a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it. at the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand. obviously, any small bump into the stand will once again set this off. using it at home, i've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful, but obviously this unit is far from ideal. since then, i've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand, and though i haven't really put through its paces yet, this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable, and only costs a few bucks more (on stage msa9508 posi-lok sidemount boom). for anyone considering this product, i highly recommypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the on stage msa9508 posi-lok sidemount boom. you will be far far happier.cheers! 
i thought i could take the smell. i couldn't.otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding.the case is nice too, but everything smells like the chinese rubber smell at harbor freight tools. (sulfur?)i tried airing it out for a week with no success.If you have no sense of smell, get one. 
the material it's made of is good, and it holds the guitar. the only things i don't like are 2.1)each of the corners has a cap. the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off.2)the part at the bottom that looks like a u (used to hold the guitar) it spins... it means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still, so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight.i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one. 
it's semi-secure on carpeting or hard floor, but all together i am pretty unsatisfied with this stand. the bottom piece has no way to lock in place, and although with the guitar on it it is more stable, i am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy...i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall. this one? meh. not worth the purchase in my opinion... booooooooo. 
er who has, upon personal inspection, discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar. i returned it.i've &#34;first act&#34; brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed. 
this arrived with one f the security strap and metal part...broken! ok...i bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option...it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it!obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box.of course,i could not recommhis product to anyone...most disappointing purchase! 
purchased these for a new heritage h-575 arch top. a few months later, the high E string unwound from the ball overall good strings, good sound -- this set simply didn't last very long. i will replace with 12s however. for me the 11s felt a little loose. the 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box. i have 12s on an epiphone joe pass model. i'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s. 
the version i picked came with a grounding wire, claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic-producing snap, crackles, and pops. if you believe that, continue to do so, and maybe you'll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device. speaking more pragmatically, i've found some use for the item only when loose, conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc. 
i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop 7000 locks. i recommhe 7000 model. they both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way, but these are just to big and clumsy. the 7000 model does the same and doesn't take as much space. you will need the straps to either be thin at the or your strap buttons/pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units. this is true for either one of the models. i have a regular nylon 2&#34; levy strap and these two models (7000 and 7007si) work well, but i prefer the smaller, rounder model (7000). 
they only fit if you have enough room in your strap button, if not they will just pop right out. i threw mine away. 
i even called dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic. the guy at dunlop told me \"oh yes, they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic\". that is not the case. i purchased multiple units, and it will cost me more to return to amazon than it's worth. but basically i know have hunks of plastic that i could use to make a sculpture!because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up, the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap, please reply to this feedback.what really frosts me is that i called dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don't know their products well enough to be recommg product. it's called, train your people!!! 
hard to believe this was so bad. i have a planet waves locking guitar strap, which is a dream, and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap. however, it is so thick that it can't really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap, and when i tried to lock it, the two pieces came apart. go with the planet waves lock straps. 
i bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what i found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something). the release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.bottom line: if you don't mind the extra effort and don't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using, then maybe you will enjoy it. for everyone else, look elsewhere. 
barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer's defects ... the unit does what it was meant to do. i do however question whether the word \"pro\" should apply to this system. although the 1/4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer, the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system. the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about. to its defense, it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away.after playing with the device for a couple more minutes, i noticed that any movement whether i kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and i moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception. even the length of the mic cord, whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sg unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality. yikes!!! perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which i previously described above. i'm afraid this would not be a very usable and deple device for my purposes. i'll probably be returning this unit asap. 
i bought this because--hey, a wireless mic for $13? why not? i might be able to use this in a public address system--the connections all work, and it makes sounds, but the static is unbearable no matter how much i fiddle with different, the adjustment screw in the receiver... nothing works. the audio is always clipped. don't even think of using this for music. 
arrive, in trashed packing, but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard... certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it. 
i got these for a custom les paul 5 string bass i had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses. also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use. i had never used strap locks before and don't think i will again. 
our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago. every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p-bass...not good. my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekhe problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself. we've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.we tried to make the shallers work but just could not. maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us. 
no where on the description does it say that the mic clip is not included. the only place is on the box after you have received the item. there's no instruction (which is fine). but in the product description it doesn't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can't use it.i bought this and have it shipped second day because i need to use it and now i can't because it doesn't come with a mic clip which i have to spnother 5-10 to get it plus shipping. the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip. but without it, i felt cheated. 
the only reason i'm not giving this one star is that i didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. i got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. we have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. nope. this pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way. avoid. 
i purchased this as my first guitar slide. i loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. i almost cut myself! i will never buy a glass slide again, i recently bought a dunlop brass slide and love it. the difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. i would not suggest this to anyone. the metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. there's a reason all pros use metal! the review below is wrong. slides are meant to cover your entire finger, all the way to the tip. you don't bour finger to play slide. you retune your guitar to an open tuning. just thought i would point that out. 
cheap crappy strap. it's too stiff, not comfortable at all. i regret purchasing this... save your money, go hunt for a coach strap or something similar. they are expensive but worth it. 
this is my first guitar belt, it is not a good fit, the connection to the guitar is far too thick, i try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage. other than that it is usable, sort of, but i am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead, the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with. 
i've two of these stands. on one of them, the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld. if you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand, you'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there. mine lost its weld, so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - i was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor!update: 1/9/12 glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand. beware! ...and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in..............wait for it................china. that may explain why it failed, but glen ingles could have offered to replace it. i guess he doesn't want me to buy any more of his products, or refer others to his products. well, that's his policy. that's okay, he's got competition, and i'll be purchasing from them instead. 
my problem is that i am used to playing hohner golden melody and special 20 harps. i guess i should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings. these harps have no volume. don't waste your money on them. i guess the only thing worth having is the case, but the case has no handles or carry strap.5/25/14 - i said the case had no handle, well i take that back. there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat. i was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it. with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside. 
disappointing; was looking for to receiving these.but; mostly they are unplayable. leak air badly. easier learning bagpipes than these things.save your money and get some harps that actually work.decent case though. 
i have other harmonica's but thought i'd like a set of blues harps. i thought that if it's made by hohner, it must be fairly good. wow, was i wrong. too hard to push notes through them. i wouldn't recommhese to anyone. 
crikey, where to begin. firstly, i hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet. secondly, they mismarked one of the packets, so it appeared i had two &#34;d&#34; strings, instead of two &#34;e&#34; strings. lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! they were tinny and clangy sounding. i've never heard worse strings. fortunately, i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med. light, as well. i replaced the godawful martins with the ernie ball's and they were far, far better! shame on martin for such a piss poor product. i'll never buy their strings again. 
i am very disappointed. the guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body.it is unusable until repaired.update: it has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller (amazon), and have not received any communication. 
dampit was recomm to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and i have used the standard model for some time. it seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.i used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while i was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.later i wound up trying the humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a dreadnought, i took to putting the dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a planet waves microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the f the cloth to soak it. then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the f the polishing cloth to cover the wet ith dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. worked great.so i ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. they now ship without the clips. company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though i didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. more importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when i pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. so i sent it back to amazon for a refund. no problem getting the refund, but i'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.if you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the om model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else. 
i wanted to like this. i really did. the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;perfect&#34;. however, the unit i received was cr@p, and i'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. the one i got kept cutting in and out. you might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. and when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. frustrating.i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. the so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. bummer. any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?cheers 
the only instrument this works well on is my yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings i want more pressure, i advise getting the ns capo that is not \"lite\ i prefer that one above this model. 
i ordered one of these because i like my other planet waves capo a lot (i believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;lite&#34;). however, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a martin jumbo acoustic). it will barely bhe strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.i'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. it doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as i can tell. unless i just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, i wouldn't recommt for any guitar without a thick neck.my recommion is the classic kyser capo thats more deple and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). if you are looking for the screw-down style, i would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;lite&#34;. 
it is inexpensive but is difficult to use anywhere with other noise..i used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning, although probably would not be used by most musicians.. other than that i think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. i would not recommt. 
it doesn't seem to work. i think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water. 
the sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long. also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.i'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it. 
the chorus is subtle... but it seems lacking to me. it is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have. 
this thing is useless. good idea, but way too light/rickety to be useful. unless you're constantly aware of it, 99% of the time you'll p just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it. pass on this. 
i've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so i guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore useless. thanks to this problem i am only able to use two slots out of twelve. it's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this. 
it's really not a 200w system. the booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and i doubt it is really even that powerful. the wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it. my shure xlr wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug. the instrument input works ok with my taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud. i guess it's ok as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals. 
this system works just okay. try to turn it up and you get bad feedback.my microphone stopped working shortly after i purchased this item. i contacted pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them.they couldn't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one, or where i could even buy a replacement.very frustrating! 
i have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, i have had enough.the main problem with this tuner is the usability.the tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.the needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever i pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.the poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.enough said, i bought a new tuner, the seiko sat800, for a bit more money that this.the main differences between sat800 and the ca-40:sat800 has a build-in light, ca-40 does not.ca-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, sat800 does not.sat800 has a auto and manual mode, ca-40 has auto.sat800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1e, 2e, etc, ca-40 displays only displays the alphabet, e for all oactaves.sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off, ca-40 does not.the needle graph on the seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.i wholly recommou do not purchase this tuner. i was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on amazon and i hope you would not be. 
this tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. as soon as i insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low b flat and stays there... even if the guitar and bass are not on the other at first i thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, i also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input. 
i've been very disappointed with this tuner. when i've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right(sharp) then back to the left(flat). i have two(2) other tuners i bought from wal-mart and i always get accurate tunings from them. i bought this korg because it's a brand name and the company has an outstanding reputation. even though my tow(2) wal-mart tuners are older, they both still work better than this korg. 
there are better tuners out there. far better. this could be good, but it seems to me that all korg products seem to think of standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to standard (especially when tuning the g string)! i personally play exclusively in standard for my electric playing, but sometimes i want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. this piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using \"f\" or \"c\" notes. i have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (i say that with love) that play in open tunings. trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere. 
this would have been a nice slide if i could get it on my finger. i'm borderline skinny and it still won't fit. save your money unless your under 10 years old. 
lets face it, in general string winders are pretty much all the same right? wrong! i went with this one because i trusted the dunlop name. what a let down. on the second guitar i used it on the handle and the head separated, sure you can press it back together, but after separating several times on every string, it gets a little old....quick. already ordered a different one to replace it. one thing i cant stand is inferior tools. 
ok its cheap. you knew that when you bought it. i really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture. it was only one and it was red. broke with first use. 
in the old days, we used tobe able to buyall 6 nylon clear strings....now tis almost impossible....with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar....one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings...very nice, resonant, and clean...not shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to bebass strings i dont know...again, like someone else noted the obvious>>>>>sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is gigantic.this makes the move from the d to the g string too noticablecant they even make 6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even ?makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally...sucks bad now.oohthanks man 
this strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good, also doesn't fit an instrument where there's no place to hook it . i returned mine, as it just didn't fit well for my uke or mandolin. 
sorry f...this one is just a waste of money. get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots. 
don't know what i expected for such a cheap price, but this product's quality is in line with its price. also, the fit over my ukulele's fretboard is very tight, making it hard to put on and remove. 
this one is probably closer to a $150 guitar. the fit and finish is quite nice but at the f the day it's just like most of the other made in china guitar. from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200, but i'm not at all impressed. one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they're a jack of all trades but a master of none.i recently bought a johnson jg-610-n, a johnson jg-620-n, a bristol bd-16, a jasmine s35, and this yamaha. if i'd only played the yamaha i'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side i can definitely say it's not at all amazing. the bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better. the johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish. the jasmine is nice but i haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.the yamaha fg700gs is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low unch. now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great. the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison. also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit \"hive mind\" where everybody buys into a hype. maybe i got a dud guitar, but i doubt it, they're all made in the same factory. 
i bought this to connect a technics tt with an audio technica cartridge to my newer onkyo receiver with no phono input. the unit did work but i had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume. in addition i have an onkyo m3040 connected to the receiver that i use for as a zone 2 amplifier. with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp. they are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop. i do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.this unit may work perfectly fine with a behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all. i am returning it. 
the mixer is good for the price but i had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside. the packing way below average. as a matter of fact, it was the only outer box without any cushioning. after seeing those ups and fedex delivery videos i would not pack a ups or fedex shipping item in such a poor packing. however, the great seller ( i am referring to amazon) immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit. second unit too had the similar packing but no damages. worked fine. 
considering the price is so cheap on these, i took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. to say that i used it \"rarely\" is an understatement - maybe once a month when i have friover for jamming as a way to get my vdrums and a bass di through my powered wedges. that said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume all the way up.aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. however, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero. 
this pedal, in short, sucks. there's no point to having an a/b pedal if it adds a huge amount of hiss to your sound. behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this. 
i'd give this 1 and a half stars if i could. this little amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it. it is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this. i can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output, and hardly anything in the other. i have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second. i can still use this, but hardly. i really don't like this. 
it's a decent unit, but stopped working completely after about 6 months. tried everything i could, but it's gone. i would not recommhis pedal. 
behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light, cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging. i just didn't want to sp100 on the boss version, but you get what you pay for! another thing that i hate is it's really hard to change the battery, unlike the boss pedals. save your money and steer clear of this one. i also bought a behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out. 
if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. pay the extra money and get something quiet. others complained about this and they were right. if you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. some complained about each band boosting others. this is more of a user problem than manufacturing. if you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. in this respect, its like an mxr 6 band. 
bought this because of all the great reviews, butthis doesn't work, just like the last beringer product i bought. will i ever learn? very disappointing.UPDATE- now working; got my mate an aussie genius to have a look.found pedal wasn't engaging when pushed down.took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on; sheer genius.worked fine with cover off; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber. and it still works.amazing sound actuallystill not sold on berhinger though 
ok i understand it now - i use abelton live 8 and thought this would be and easy, read cheap, interface to record some instruments with. wrong! i am returning it. it does not work, has no drivers and is not detected on my mac (my mac finds everything). bought the focusrite unit instead. got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings. save your money and time. buy the focusrite interface or one of the others. yes over $100 but you either want feedback, hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance. it also lacks 1/4 plug, one rca input, you need an addapter. not what i thought i was getting - dumb me. 
not very bright. not very flexible. too big. clunky. i really don't like it. i wish i had went in a different direction. 
soi f you want to turn distor t off,u cannot.dig?it s always on...alwaysif you like hard rock that wayu need this tiny gig thingie 
while the product came as described, the build quality felt a little lacking. on the website it mentioned that it accepts the shure ksm32 threading but it does not, so if you're threading matches the ksm32, look elsewhere. 
i picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store. who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right? the price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well. the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate. it gets you in the ballpark, but just barely. strike a note once, and it's sharp. play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune. i think the korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better. 
strings rust very easily, yield fairly poor tone and break often, though they have the same bg ability as 9-.42. 
pros:-price point-good, clean audio quality when working.-changeable mesh ballscons:-limited upper frequency response (&#62;8khz)-one stopped working after about half an hour of use. it was not dropped or abused in any way.-requires nearly direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver for any distance greater than 10 feet. 
they say 2-4 months, i've never come close to even a month. usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks. if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. i don't recommhese. 
i bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage. i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d-28, but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.imagine my profound disappointment.really, boss??? this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours. this thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the review s on-line. seems like it is part of the design. it's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. totally unusable, as far as i'm concerned. by the way, i tested it direct to a pa as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat). 
summaryacoustic sounds &#34;ok&#34;, but noisy in weird ways. i returned it. price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.pros- boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable- standard 9v power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs.- variety of acoustic sounds possible. (personally, i only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- while i have several boss pedals, i think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small. i prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.details:the basic concept is good. i had an ac-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. it wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. it was also just noisy in the pedal chain. adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. however, i sold that model because i didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and i wasn't happy with the sound. at the time, the ac-2's were selling for about $85 new. boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac-3.i bought the ac-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the ac-2 -- and they did, a little. but not enough to keep it. i returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. i think the ac-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead. they make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;. the 400 has reverb on the pedal. i opted for the 300 and got it for $25. i expect the durability will be lower on the behringer than the boss as it has a plastic case. however, this is an effect i pull out just once in a while and since i can buy 4 or 5 or 6 behringers for the price of a boss....if it breaks...i'll just buy another.i also have a boss gt-100 multi-effects unit. you can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the behringer or out of the boss ac-3. the least cost effective of those choices is the ac-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.i'm not saying its a bad pedal, i'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. if they would fix the noise issues, i might have even kept it. i did opt to keep the behringer for those times i'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. this boss pedal just didn't work that well for me. 
i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac-33 acoustic amp. the pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy. however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate. this is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch. the worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out. the only way i could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made. for the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that boss would put out a better product. i also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question. i would highly recommhat you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site. 
when i purchased this i'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar. guess what? as far as i can tell, there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with. this is not worth the money. 
disapointed. the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound. it sound muffled. i will have to replace it soon. 
..it works.but expect some flaws.first,finding a driver to use was a pain.it doesn't come with a software disc,so look on behringer's support site for driver download.whatever driver you do use it kills all other audio,you can't run any other media player and get sound.my advice is unless you have a dedicated pc or laptop for using this...get something else. 
in fact, i don't think this hosa gtr215r cord lasted 2 hours. one step on the cord and it came apart. this purchase is the very reason why i'm looking to buy a wireless system. maybe if you're using this to run a pa i would recommt. but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldn't recommhis item....but to be fair, i would recommireless to any performer. you'll p saving money over the long haul. 
the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both non-responsive. i tried the mic with other cables i have lying around that i know work, and i got nothing; it was like the mic wasn't plugged in at all. and the cable included in this pack, well, the plastic (not metal) connector to the mic was cracked. i still tried it with a difference mic... static.i can't blame amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.the stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package. i was impressed at how much of is isn't plastic.Still... i can't recommhis product. 
the good:this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.the bad:the tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination, unless you like hyper-distorted noise. the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied. the effects are hit and miss as well. plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive.throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, i'd be hard-pressed to recommhis product unless you really need to practice through headphones. 
it's a good ideal but the big problem i have is if ya are using a tube amp. ( have a 65' twin reverb f tube ) ya get one hell of a hum. it's so bad i just can't use it at all. i'm not sure about a transistor amp. but who uses those ???? 
doa...no good, out of the box,plug it, nothing.....no way to st back (i`m not from the states)....meaning...i just wasted away $40 something bucks (add shipping)....i did bought a behringer pedal before (tremolo/pan) with good results, but i guess there`s two sides to this particular low economy pedals....well, i`ll man up and buy something else... 
i heard great things about the s6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, i bought it based upon reviews. i've played it for a year, and after spg many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:- the seagull is comparatively unattractive. its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- the cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- the laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;/resonant during playing.- the satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- the cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom eems muddy.- the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok.- the binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something i've not encountered before.- i can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!all in all, it is an ok instrument that stands out simply because it's made in canada for asian/mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. in fact, for the price range, i can get a just-as-good asian/mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.i don't regret getting it, but i feel like i overpaid for what i received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, i have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. seagull to me is over-hyped.thanks for reading! 
it sounds very artificial, i remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had, now that i use it with a better amp, it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it's not even worth the price i payed for it before. i also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didn't want to lock with my guitar cable and when i took it apart, there was no way for me to fix it other than sg it to be replaced. shitty pedal. 
ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home \"12/23/11\" and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset, i would not returned because i don't feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for. 
in my experience these cables were not great. the connectors rattle, they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise. i can't expect miracles at that price-point but i certainly expected better. i avoid this brand of cables. 
i bought this unit for a friand i could compare with others overdrives i already have. i think the mxr badass custom modified overdrive or way huge green rhino are better choise. 
i am a tone freak. i bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff. at the time i had never owned a big muff. i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound. i later took it to my frihouse and matched settings with a real big muff. the difference was huge. the big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box. i later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging. i am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal. i would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space 
it was not what i wanted. when a person has a low Income we can not afford what we can not use. i was looking for what is called shimmer most reverbs do not have shimmer as the rv600 because digitech called shimmer, string swell and volume swell is linked to the violin sound it cost me 30 0 its called slow motion for a reason because it has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear it is with over drive being played on the high Strings. it might be good for playing with a bow, i have no Idea because i can not afford a bow. 
i just got this and i've noticed that it when i activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom ut of my tone... i have a crybaby that doesn't have the range the 847 does but its 10x's more transparent. there may be other factors at play here as it is new, but the lesson is: try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you. 
my hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder. the gel is pretty dense, so it's kind of hard and squishy and very heavy! i found that it just added more weight. i'm not using it. i would look elswhere for a different product. 
to heavy....it doesn't stay where you need it. slips down becuase of wieght.. get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar... 
these cans were decent, back when they were just above 100 bucks. they've inflated to 160 and that's just ridiculous. there is better in this price range. the srh840's for example on ebay for 120~ bucks new, does everything better than these cans. the m50's have really punchy bass, and extremely stringent highs, they're very loose in the low and their mids are recessed. that combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience. the pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable, whilst having an almost starchy texture to them. the headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath. these phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all, which means for gaming, these will be pretty terrible. they do some... some... new genres alright, but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to. they also can't do lighter genres like jazz and classical due to their poor positoning. there are much much better monitors in this price range than these, the shure srh840 as i've said before totally outclass these headphones in all areas.stay away, don't fall victim to the noob hype. 
garbage if you like it...then buy it.this is not how the world of music sounds.too much bass and other garbage...are you guys really HEARING anything ?world has gone bass crazy since about 1981...more and more..we lost analog, we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp3, and now to put morecrap into our ears, they give you onefrequency...bass only , take it or leave it.will go find real headphones, thanks.kb 
if you want to use this to power up a tascam dr series digital recorder, i have a less expensive solution for you: if you own a usb wall charger (like a cell phone charger), you can use that to power your device through its usb port. that's a lot cheaper than spg twenty-something dollars on an additional wall wart! 
i purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price. after trying to use it i promptly returned it. i do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows. i have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer. i tried recording on the h2 using it's line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my mackie sound board or my stereo receiver. no matter how i set the levels the recording on the h2 was very distorted. i played with the record levels and the agc and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal. i have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean, good quality sound. the problem with my h2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal, which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp. recording from the internal mics seems to work fine. i have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the zoom recorders are the only brand where i have found this problem.the h2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings, look for something else. i exchanged this model for an h4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal, but not as bad as the h2. i finally  up getting the tascam dr-07 which i am very happy with. it has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder. 
if you can read the tiny little screen, this thing records nicely. but it's a pain in the axx to move from one selection to the other. there were a couple of times i almost threw against the wall. it has a tcy to completely freeze up and the on/off switch does nothing. you have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again. 
the cables are great for the price cant go wrong i have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables.don't buy this cables they keep failing, cheap material with what i spent on them you could buy a couple decent ones 
i have finally learned my lesson.i have purchased a number of these over the last year or two.. and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say \"good for static applications\" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage, even along the length of the cable, not just at the connectors...but they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok.but now, after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer i checked it out and it seemed to work.a week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain.. yup..the cable.so by all means buy these on price, but when you get your items..please fully check them out.. a simple \"does it work yes/no\" is clearly not good enough, as i learned 
be careful; i have a small recording studio, so we put our cables through a lot, and these guys just don't last. they were fine for the first few months, but then they started to die like a murder mystery. seriously, one after another they would just go, for no apparent reason.fine one second, and then it would just go horribly staticky. i actually had two blow at one time, and thought my pa was shot. thankfully, it was just these cables. not GOOD. sp little extra on another brand. these have been my favorite:gls audio 25ft cable cords 
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people. the strap is about 6\" too short for my seagull s6 guitar. i will say the build quality is great but too short, is and remains, too short. i will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extput into the strap. i just can't understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short.2/22/2013 i fired off an email to levy and the long and \"short\" of all this is you will have to fork over another $30 to buy an extfor this strap. i don't quite understand why they don't make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $30 to make it work right in the first place. here's a link to the extoptionlevy's leathers mmgxl-2.5-brn strap ext link removed the irony here is i managed to buy the last one for the immediate future.this is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider. i got the extstrap and it does not match the original so now i have this cobbled up looking guitar strap. it's sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other. i will keep this strap but sure feel like i've been had on this purchase... the terms bait and switch come to my mind. 
levy's leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material, especially on the edges. it cuts into your neck horribly, even thru a shirt. yukko. the fake leather on the are unbelievably cheap. 
i have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem, but i got literally 8 plug-ins, and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain. it's like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both  soooo it's pretty much useless to me. i guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them, i guess you could plug this into it but i really see no point. i would've shipped it back i lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss. i think i payed like $8 for it so whatever. i would recommoing to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male and the female 
i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a &#34;1 spot&#34; brand plug. it is not what i received. instead i received a generic plug for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose, but a really cheap version. the plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic. the original 1 spot plug has much smaller plugs, great for saving space on a pedal board, and the wires are soft and &#34;rubbery&#34;, again making it easier to work with on a pedal board, specially if you're working with a pedal board like pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars. i informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would se the correct one. in my email to them i included an image of the original packaging of the 1 spot 8 plug to make sure there would be no mistake, but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug. i emailed them again for a refund, which they promptly did. i can say, that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money. i imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 spot plug, wouldn't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors. i strongly recommsphe extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 spot 8 plug. 
first behringer pedal i have returned. almost no effect provided by pedal. i have returned the unit. not worth it. lousy pedal. 
i give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do. i give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period. generously, i'll give it 2stars. something like this really should last at least a year or more. cheap parts/manufacturing? 50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature. 
sound is not so good. strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything. 
i used ac30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these.sound quality of ac30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrs clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.for people worried about construction, these turned out to be very sturdy (ac30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same).even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy ac30, the latter has acceptable cleans.. 
as an amateur musician, i'm always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such. i thought this gadget would do the trick, but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didn't meet my expectations. 
bought this years ago. it was a nice long cable that i bought figuring it'd be durable but it didn't last. maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig... if i was better with wiring i'm sure it's fixable but all in all it didn't last as long as i'd hoped. 
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved. gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison. both have tweed jackets however the hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the gls cable does. i would recommhe gls product over the hosa product. 
the cable hisses, crackles and pops right out of the package. save your money and buy a better cable. i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective. i would definitely not buy this product again or recommt to anyone else. 
the vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone. it now rest at bottom of a box. 
as i've heard with the pyle pro amps, i received mine today, and it was defective. only one channel worked, and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep. the packaging was very good though, so i'm thinking this looks like a refurb/used, and they listed it as new. already printed the return shipping label, and it will head back to the amazon warehouse on monday... 
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic/electric hohner guitar. i measured the whole at 3 7/8&#34;, but this cover does not even come close to fitting! it measures 4 1/6&#34; in diameter, so check your guitar closely! 
doesn't reduce sound worth a darn. i thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things. muddies it up a bit maybe, but not really a reduction in db. 
these speakers worked great for 14 months. last week (4/8/13), one of them wouldn't power up all the way. the problem is getting worse every time i try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working. it seems there is a problem with the capacitors that i did read about in a few reviews. i took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. i only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. i contacted m-audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. one on the east coast and one on be west coast. i've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the internet and on the m-audio support site. m-audio doesn't stand behind their products, and i'll never purchase anything from them again. 
on the plus side, these monitors look and feel amazing. they are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.they don't sound horrible. i mean, they are not computer speakers or anything. the sound is very forward, i would say harsh. that's not uncommon among studio monitors. there is definitely a lot of clarity here. not a ton of bass, but that's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size. there's a few schools of thought on studio monitors. some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music, others think they should sound more like a normal speaker. these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first. i definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this. any flaws would be quite noticeable.i previously used krk rp8's so i can compare these to them. granted, they are larger and more expensive, although they are also budget monitors. i liked them better than these. they were clear but also sounded nicer and, of course, had much more bass.i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in...see if i could improve the situation...but one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it's turned on. the buzz increases in volume over time. i tried moving them to a different location, turning the volume down, even disconnecting the audio feed (so they were only plugged into the power). nothing stopped the buzz. if they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds. so i sent them back. i wasn't really impressed with the sound and i'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so i'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead. maybe behringer 3031a's or something. i think it's worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full-sized monitor. 
sound nice, but very unreliable bx5a deluxe.i own a pair of yamaha ns 10s and event 20-20s, and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.2 years ago i purchased a set of regular bx5a's, and they lasted about 1 1/2 years, and then the faulty capacitors leaked.i just replaced them with the bx5a deluxe model, and after only one week. one of the internal amps will no longer power up.i need a pair of affordable av shielded monitors that i can depn, and these cheap m-audio monitors are not it.I am back to using my 20-20's with slight av noise until i find a decent av shielded monitor.m-audio was a much better company before avid took them over! 
in an attempt to see what's new in the pick industry, i decided to dive in and give these a go. they are way too flimsy if, like me, you use a heavier pick. i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just can't compete. not only were they too flimsy, but when i played with any aggression (heavy rock-based material), the picks would fly out of my hands. this was a huge disappointment. 
good grip, but too flexible, and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks. probably good for strumming, but not good for lead. 
this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal. i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature. but was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with.anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay. and on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem, hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise. also the pedal just started oscillating a few times. i would have given the behringer us600 five stars if it kept working, it tracked nice and didn't tone suck too bad. 
some things are great values, others are cheap. the behringer is cheap. the clips are cheap. the clip that holds the 9v broke after the first change. the clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic. if you get stuck using batteries, plan on 3-4 hours worth of use. it's also a noisy pedal. like noisier than my dyna comp and od pedals combined. like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise. if you leave it plugged into your cables, even when powered down, it will eat your batteries.all of those negatives aside, you are paying less than $40 for a reverb pedal that has several usable features. the 63' spring is great, the plate is also really good. it also has a worth-the-price-alone \"space\" feature. also known as shimmer (a synth playing behind your instrument). paired with a chorus effect, you can get some really cool tones.the rv600 is not without merit, but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features. if you gig or record and need a reverb...well...you aren't even looking at this pedal. if you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn't have a reverb built in, this is a good option. 
had i known what i was getting i would never have ordered it. there are gig bags and there are gig bags. i've ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags. i expected more. this one offers almost no protection. the only reason i have not returned it yet is that the return shipping will leave little to refund, but may p returning it anyway.it did fit my kala ka-tg with room to spare. 
unhappy with it, actually i already replaced them. the method of attachment is poorly designed, it doesn't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls, the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions. expensive locks too. 
i had some issues with my 18-watt all tube amp so i experimented and replaced all the tubes. issues not only continued but worsened. hum, noise, volume fade, unwanted distortion at low volumes. i eventually put back the original el84s and that didn't help. once i removed the tung-sol 12ax7 preamp tubes and replaced, the hum stopped, sound quality of the amp was consistent, quiet and back to par. my experience with the tung-sol tubes was very, very negative. they caused me to go out and buy another amp. i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast. i'll never buy this brand again. 
don't buy this chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand. it is barely workable for two.it is easy to set up, but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place. and you absolutely have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.the best thing these stands are built for are v type guitars such as my jackson rhoads as long as you can put them back to back. for les paul and strat type axes, their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow, stick like feet of the stand, especially when they are new. you can't tilt the feet up to try to lore stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible. so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand. if you just gotta buy something from on stage, get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it up being better balanced. but really, you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for. 
this seems to have been a rare case but still, i had my ukulele on is and it snapped, i'm worried what might happen with a guitar or a bass 
i purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when i placed my guitar in it. upon close inspection, the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube. the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe 25&#34; wall, so don't expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off- even if it is welded better than mine was. just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs- it is literally that thin of metal tubing.for $10-11 i did not expect perfection, so to it's credit- it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars.this stand does have one other good quality- it is cheap! since it was less that $11, i cannot see going through the hassle of returning it. i was able to carefully weld mine back together- but this would probably not be an option for most. the stand might work fine if you don't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up- but if you need portability and durability- i would definitely purchase a better quality stand. 
this is a fantastic product that is well made. the plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use. this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition.the tool is extremely useful. i have just started playing with a band, and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in. with the wheel, i immediately know what chords to choose from. i also know what notes are in each chord. in addition, it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing.the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys. for example, say you're playing the i, iv, and v chords in the key of c., but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in bb. all you need to do is dial the wheel to bb, find out the new i, iv, and v chords, and start playing. the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze.i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair. this is a very useful product at a fair price.no, i am not affiliated with the company at all. i'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool.in my opinion, this is a five star product. 
when set on blink, they blink way too fast. when not set on blink, all 4 lights come on and focused into just 1 spot that the combined color come out white. useless design. 
i purchased 4 of these, of the four 1 was no good on arrival another failed after 2 short time uses. i will not buy more. the first one was returned after some resistance from the seller the second one had passed the warranty time before it had failed. suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these. for the $$$ should be more deple. 
this capo isn't quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar. if i position it just so it will work as long as i don't bump it or a string will pop out of one side. 
just use a cloth or paper towel. 
my issue with the pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply. i have a voodoo lab pedal power 2 plus.the documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply. however, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.first of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board. the fitment to the power supply is there... sort of. there's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together. i wasn't worried about this, since i doubt i'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.the second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter. once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out. you'll probably have to break them. it's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.the main issue i have with this board relating to my voodoo lab power supply is this. once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board. you can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.i really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the voodoo lab power supply i own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, i wish i could return this board - except i can't, because it now has holes drilled in it. (you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it.)basically, i paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro. needless to say, i'm not very pleased. 
from the product description, i expected something far more robust than this unit. by and large, i've had great experiences with behringer pedals, but this reverb unit is the wimpiest i have ever used in 40 years of playing - no stronger than the reverb in a 5w first act amplifier. 
i bought one of these for a vintage f showman that doesn't have built in reverb. put a battery in and plugged it in. very simple. but the sound was horrible! no setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb i ever heard or would want to hear. the closest i could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful. on the other hand, the reverb from my korg ax-100g (that i was using on another rig) was great. maybe my dr600 was not functioning properly, but i don't think so. i think that's the way it really sounds. so i got a return authorization from amazon (very easy - never fails), put it back in the box and ups picked it up the next day and i got a full refund.jm tepper 
this \"would\" be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity, it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum, pluck or riff ring the reverb relatively worthless if you 'want a lot of reverb\". what the hell was behringer thinking??? 
the plastic knob that you use to tighten the ball and socket doesn't grip very well and even the lightest camera will slip and sag. it's a great idea but not well executed. 
the plastic piece that screws the wire into the as made of very thin plastic, and cracked in two within a week of light use. i guess i can redo it with electrical tape to make it work, but i have many whirlwind cables that have lasted me 15+ years. i expected more from this manufacturer, but i guess the quality is not the same as it used to be. 
often, we get what we pay for. after researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks, i chose solid items for reasonable prices.i should've known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle - the quality of the cable. this item simply didn't ever work - it arrived with a bent pen on one and even when we attempted to straighten it, it didn't connect well onto the mixer board. the microphone as a very shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic.don't buy this item - sphe relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand. 
is strictly on the aspect of a bass guitar, not regular guitar. 
if you're a metalhead, stay away!! i tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey rogue g10 blows it out of the water. this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion. it's great for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic f crunch. but if you demand metal, get far away! 
great price but unfortunately this product didn't work for me. fortunately i had no problem returning it for a full refund so overall i'm happy with the results. 
this works in some applications, but doesn't work in many others. even when detected by the software, it will not work with line 6 equipment. too bad, because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop. 
i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks. also with my win7 x64 machine. i tried it with a variety of midi capable gear including trying to update firmware on fx hardware, sg and receiving midi pc and midi cc, as well as transmitting midi clock in and out. i simply couldn't get this to work most of the time. active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely.in contrast i purchased the -mu's xmidi 1x1 tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time i use it.i should have totally returned this product. instead it's in a landfill. 
doesn't wotk with v-amp 3. doubt it works at all. red light always stays on and i've never seen the green light. 
i don't know how this will work with other midi instruments but i tried it with the roland td9 drums and although it does transmit the data, the drum map is totally off. the respective triggers (hihat, hihat pedal, etc) are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the pc f it, it was just a freaking hassle. i needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my notebook (which doesn't have a midi input) but i gave up in the nd went with my desktop pc and its midi interface. 
my advice- spore and get something that will work with all applications. cheap midi may get you there, but if not you have to buy another. yep, always the gamble. 
i may have misunderstood the product description but i prefer the string tied to the f my acoustic over this. my issue is that it makes my guitar really high up when i play in a standing position and there is no way to adjust the strap the make it longer. if you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you. don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the product itself; it just wasn't what i thought. 
purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock martin and it just didn't fit well for me. also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove. a string style worked a lot better, was a lot easier to attach and remove, and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed. 
they have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don`t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by d addario get some real picks like dunlop tortex 
i like the jim dunlop .60mm pitch black guitar picks best. if you want your electric guitar to sound like eddie van halen, joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a boss gt-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. search google for boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. 
i have a real problem with these patch cables. i got them as a christmas gift but they don't stay in my pedals' input jacks without causing problems and having to push them in on occasion. most problematic is the connection between my ehx memory boy and digital memory man... never had problems with any other cables here, but these refuse to stay put without having to constantly adjust. 
i thought it was my jack for a while, then i noticed it wouldn't stay in any pedal. there is no \"click\" assuring that the cable is in place... and there's a reason for that, it isn't! slips right out of every pedal i have. not reliable. 
these cables are excellent quality cables, however, if you are trying to patch your pedals together in a closely spaced setup, these cables are rather bulky and stiff.the large size of the right angle connectors requires you to space your pedals out more than you might prefer, especially compared to some of the other pedal patch cables that are available from companies such as hosa. 
bought it after read reviews. i had signal loss using these cables.. it's like having a loose connection inside the cable. my connections were on and off, i thought i had a dead pedal.. i have to wiggle and hold to get signal. it's too flexible almost like twizzlers (no kidding!). if you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables, go get the one from pro co, i bought it very cheap from sweetwater on ebay, surprisingly very good quality and looks durable! 
i purchased the h4n after being unhappy with the h2's performance most significant where i couldn't record a good sounding signal that wasn't distorted with the line in jack. only to find that the h4n has the same problem but not as bad. if i try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the h4n's 1/4 inch jacks, it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal. it appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp, adjusting the gain doesn't correct it. i contacted zoom's tech support about the h2 and was told that i likely had a defective unit. i returned the h2 and decided to give zoom another chance and try the h4n after seeing many positive reviews.i really like the h4n's design, the menus and controls are nicely organized. it feels more sturdy than the h2. the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent. most other recorders in this price range don't have xlr inputs. since i plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board, if the line in jacks don't work properly and can't accept a normal line level signal without clipping, i can't use this for what i bought it for. i have used my sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems. i've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the zoom products are the only ones where i have encountered this problem. if you are using this to record with mics, it works great, but if you need to record from line level sources, the zoom recorders may not be a good choice. i exchanged this for the tascam dr-07 and while the tascam doesn't have as many bells and whistles, it is a nice recorder and i'm very happy with it. 
the boss me-70 is not as nice as the boss gt-10 and will not let you install boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. i recommetting a boss gt-10 and then install boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. now your guitar can sound like eddie van halen, joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. search google for boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. 
i really wanted this to be a great product. the screws strip out too easily. basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out. i had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon. nope. even the pop filter fell off. i love the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage... ex: adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc. otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option. just make it one solid piece. i'm tempted to try to fix it with gorilla glue because i do love the design. it's just not strong enough. not that it's a surprise though. not much of anything is worth the money these days. it's a damn chore to return every friggin' purchase these days that they don't really have to care about actually testing products. why should they? they already have your money. i feel like i should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up. besides, what are they going to do? replace it with another broke a$$ product? better yet, refund my money for the product i paid - minus shipping???? that doesn't include the time i spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place. i want a refund, plus an hourly wage. whatever, don't buy one. companies that don't test their products don't deserve your business. what would make me happy, is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question(s): did you test this product? how did you test it? what were your results? is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence?nope 
as soon as i attached my mic, and with my strong hands, i over twisted the mic holder on the threads, and the thread piece came loose on the stand. i think i can fix it with some liquid metal, but this is not as impressive as some mic stands i've had in the past. sincerely, docafter a few months of trying to make it work. it doesn't. i changed my rating from 3 to 1 this puppy is just poor quality. 
i have three mic stands, with this one being the fourth. i still have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible.1. the top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down.2. the bottom clamp never did secure properly. it kept opening up even without a mic on it. the weight of the stand itself stripped it.i sent it back without hesitation. 
so the problem with most reviews is that people generally review things as soon as they get them when they are still in the honeymoon phase about it. i've used this in my jam lab for 4 years and use it every time i play electric (about 5-7 hours a week.)the unit itself has held up well. no problems with case or pedals. all switches, knobs, plugs, & display work fine. it doesn't have a on/off switch but that's minor. it's low profile and is easy to switch by foot. i have it going into my mixer which works fine. no feedback or buzz from it.i like the recording software, cubase, that came with it. i didn't think i'd use it much but i do. it's fun and easy to record my own songs. cubase is a little quirky and will often tell me that there is an error and it needs to close, but i've learned nothing happens and it's fine.i don't use the looper much as i have it before my digitech jam man. which, if you don't have, you need it! the drum presets are fun to use. it's a blast to set a drum track, loop a rhythm, then jam on top of it. isn't that what it's all about?my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets. the tuner is not very accurate and i use a cheapo tuner that works much better. also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isn't. some flaw i guess. also the clean presets; like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak. i don't like them at all. the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone. they rock. i use alot of the other ones as well.imho this the review ...i still like it...alot!! "unixreviewtime": 1363392000, "reviewtime": "03 16, 2013"} name ron1414 review i gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day , and visually it's hard to read because the lettering is so small. also there are many function for one knob to have, a little confusion for me. the sounds are great and the recording aspect of it is nice, but not something that is best for my needs.i am looking into a boss me-25 instead, 
i used to buy a lot of wire form these guys.... however, you need to be careful and test everything you get from them on an xlr cable tester.i didn't believe it myself...i read another reviewer had an issue with xlr cables being wired incorrectly from pin to pin. so i took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables.i got through only 4 monoprice cables before i found one that was miss-wired. now i will be checking all of them for sure.not a good start though.glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on.i suggest everyone check their monorpice cables. the testers are very cheap and may show problems you weren't aware of. 
the coversion cable didnt work. t is axlr to ubs cable. i have the red blinking light syndrome also. but i learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for st back. so izm thanks hde for wasting my time. go sell your snake oil to someone else......... 
i only bought with the idea that a \"full\" version of behringer's sequence program came with it....needless to says its a \"compact version\" and for you other imac/os x users out there????----aint worth yer timeyer better off spg your money on vst's au's that will work with osx and cubase or garageband....other than that its another interface \"i guess\" as long as you want to use rca plugs to do that with...who the !$%^ uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter????based on the software hustle im sorta sour but if yer a pc/windows owner i would get it!!!!its about the cheapest way to \"intro\" yer way in to daw/dat interface..... mainly im talkning to katz who ownnewer macs/imacs who are truying to muddle your way thru music digital interface and keyboard sequencingfor those users yer better off buying a pizza probably... 
i have a 1953 telecaster body and after installing the screw to the pickup they were to long for the body . i had to trim them down 
these types of pedals are toys. they are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with. by all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing. if not, i recommlowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay, or distortion. 
i had a friith one of these and he loves it. i got one on his recommion and when i put the batteries in it, it started smoking. it did work for awhile. i pulled the batteries out and tried to ac adapter and it smoked again, this time it did not work. i am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work, holds a grudge. i would not advise anybody to get this. 
this particular brand i've seen around and haven't heard to much about them, but the one that i got worked fine for about a couple days. it went out and i sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that i might have gotten a bad one.and i requested in a letter when i sent it in that they snother one in exchange, that didn't work out so well, with that being the only way i could rate it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one, i'd have to rate this one at the bottom... 
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day...these have been ordered for a couple of weeks...you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks...i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day...hope they work when they do finally arrive..good luck 
sounds disgusting. very bright and clear highs, nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows. don't hope to take chords on it. only on first 4 strings may be...try out f's mini amp if you're searching for a little thing, or but a bigger one. 
ok, i'm surprised that this unit is now over $15 0. i only spent $8.59 for this and i'm mad at myself. it was cheap enough that i rolled the dice to see if i could get away with a decent product for cheap. it feels solid, looks like a real direct box...but sounds like ass. i couldn't believe that pyle would put that much effort into a great \"fit and finish\" product, yet not put decent components inside. this is the noisiest piece of crap i've ever used - i  up buying another direct box (spent over $60 0). pyle has once again lived up to it's name, but they should finish the name properly and re-brand as \"pyle of s .\"sorry folks, but i'd skip this one. the 5-star ratings must be from employees. the only reason i didnt' give it one star was because it was so cheap (remember, i only spent $8.59), and i'm the one that pulled the trigger on the purchase.live and learn. why would i think plugging a $2000 0 guitar into a cheap piece of crap was a good idea? my fault. 
a loud hum will crescin every few minutes even if the ground is lifted. works great in intervals though, too bad those intervals are minutes. 
it stopped working after 2 gigs. i'm not sure why, but it is very frustrating. i guess you get what you pay for here. 
our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago. every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p-bass...not good. my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekhe problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself. we've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.we tried to make the f/shallers work but just could not. maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us. 
well 3 hours to put together got tiring and annoying as things to fall a part..however as a standalone items it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming on..however i am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one..i bought this in order to use with software recording for basic beats to fit my own songs..and it is a nightmaregoing on a week now no support help from either company..heed my warning if you want to use this with ni, ez drummer or other programs like that you must know how to reroute mapping of midi in order to use it. this is not a plug and play item you will spours of your time trying to get this to work with software...there is very little helpful info out on the net i've owned this for over a week and still never used it for its purpose yet being that its a stand alone item..there really is no MIDI support..im am close to giving up the fight and sg it back.alesis could have made this an amazing item and 1000 times easier if they simply created a midi out port on the module you could run into your daw and software.. 
it does not stick on to the guitar very well. trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but i now have a small circle in the finish of my martin. i made mistake of attaching so wife could play rocksmith and now wish i had used cheaper guitar or better yet, bought a better pickup. 
the suction cup does not work. it looks like aged. it's very hard with room temp 70f. i removed the rubber suction cup and i have to use a big paper clipper to secure it on the sound hole edge. it picks up sound ok, but not great. 
i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic. learned my lesson. should of just forked over the money for an a/e. i have a yamaha f335 i really like. i say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so i thought i'd try it. i first picked up a transducer for about $3 and experimented. i like it, sounded good then i saw this from axl and i thought i'd try it. installing it wasn't bad except i bought a set of drill bits i didn't need for $10. so i got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright. i just wanted it for playing around at home so i didn't need real great sound quality. but sound was ok except it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves i think quick connect strap connector. my other complaint is i couldn't turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching. overall product quality is good. setup was ok. price was good. sound in my opinion needs some tweaking. 
the fact that it is passive really kills it. i just could not get any sound out of it, i tried multiple placements. i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it. not worth the money, or the extra hole in your guitar. 
this is a hit-or-miss product. for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well. it's not a total loss since i can reuse the n jack with the soundhole solution i  up with. it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on. 
i've been using primarily alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spg so much for them. i figured i'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.these were the first to go on, and they were a huge step down from what i had on. the strings i took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string. they were twice as loud as these. when you take these out of the pack, they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti. they don't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do. the cons definitely outweigh the pros here.pros:-very flexible, string bare easy-easy on the fingerscons:-the most dull sound of any strings i've ever heard. especially on the low they're dreadfully lacking in rich low ound. the highs are very tinny. almost sounds like a bad recording.-your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings. it's the weirdest thing. this is especially true for the g string. it's hard to explain, but it's kind of like rubbing against something really clean, where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there's tons of squeak to boot. anyways, it sucks. grip is the last thing you want on your strings.bottom line: unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to btrings, these should not be purchased. i'll never buy again. this is the first time in my life i wanted to change brand new strings. 
if you've never had a pedalboard before i'd say pass on this one and look for one that is more user-fri. the pics and description don't show just how insanely large this is. it's too big. patch cables are crap and the power supply didn't seem sturdy enough to be kicked around.besides this, i had trouble using it (even for practice) because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals.i  up giving this one away to a frind getting a gator 'bone' and a seperate power supply. easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics/cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it's own. 
i bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps. if you want the metal sound for practice, then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill. but with the hybrid amps (vibro champ) going for not much more, you get better sounds and more settings. i am selling mine and ordered a super champ xd used in new condition for two and a half bills. this line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding. from now on its tube amps for me, even if i have to pay the price. a good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well, too. like i said, for a first amp at one bill, the line 6 isnt too bad. maybe some day i will be able to afford a princeton reverb? 
before i purchased the fbv i scoured the web to see how it works with the pod hd desktop, and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking..anyway, i lucked out and found a used one going cheap, and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the pod hd desktop & fbv express ii combo.1. first, in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express. yes, i know this sounds dumb, but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for...2. read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal.. there is no need to d/l the fbv software for this.now.. in the pod setup screens you have the option to either have the abcd buttons as abcd, or to be fs5-fs8. this behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the fbv.so.. in abcd mode you can:a) select preset a, b, c or d from the group you are currently in.b) insert a volume fx and use volume pedal...exp2c) insert another fx enabled by toe switch, and controlled by pedal as exp1d) tap temp (by tapping the currently selected preset..ie the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press/hold the current selected preset pedal)f) you have some basic control of the looper, but cannot enable it.3/10/14 edit :looper control is flawed. you can record and go to overdub, but you cannot record then play/stop the loop.. you can stop from overdub but not start the loop. seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugnice enough, but if you are like me, switching presets is way way less useful than switching fx blocks on & off. incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns od on, and delay & chorus both off, or turn one amp on and one off (channel switching).. yay!! you cry, that sounds like me so its a no to abcd and mode fs5-fs8 it is for me!..so yup in fs5-8 mode you can do that, you cana) enable/disable 4 sets of block(s) using the four pedalsb) use volume and expression options as above (ie like volume or wah, overdrive level, delay fb etc)c) basic control of looper but cannot enable itedit 3/19/14 looper control flawed as stated abovec) enable the tuner?...oh sod it. nope you can'td) tap tempo?.. nope not that either.so in summary, the express is better than nothing, but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop.. the shortboard is worth the extra, or if you are reading this before buying the pod.. get the hd500x instead. 
not so pleased with this, the seller is fine, no prob. there, its that this mic for my use is useless, it records tooo low, cant get enough volume from it 
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs. the first day it was fine, if a bit sensitive, by the third day it was broken. cheap to buy, but cheaply made. 
unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage! i tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register. the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes. 
i was looking for a portable fold-up stand that i could take to gigs and searched around. found the guardian at amazon and thought for $10, how could i go wrong? oops! wrong. the stand is sturdy and folds up nicely, but i found it next to impossible to get my f jazz bass to stand up in it. the lack of an ext support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn't blow. this is ok for a lightweight acoustic that you don't care too much about, but for for an electric guitar or bass, no way.I just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support. live and learn. 
i have an epiphone les paul and this stand does not hold it at all. the holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor. maybe it's a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric. but given that les paul is a pretty popular model of guitar, this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand. i'm rating it for what it is sold as, and for that, it gets 1 star, and only because since there is no zero. 
the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isn't very fri. snark rotates to any position i want, but intellitouch up being upside down. it works fine but it's inconvenient. 
this product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the akai pro website. technical support is also almost zero. akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products. customer service is basically \"if you have to ask, you should not buy this\". i asked the akai technical department which sequencer software i needed and they told me to go to a music store! this may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of midi knowledge and experience don't buy this product. try finding a midi tutorial that is usable. good luck with that chore.added 08nov2010: the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing. i sent an email to akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts. i find that unbelievable. 
bought this rosin to see how i would like it. i have a very light hand on the bow, so i like a rosin that is on the aggressive side. this is not. since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial & error. 
this does work as described. it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out. the reason i only gave it two stars however is because i find it so uncomfortable! its quite hard on your collarbone. i have added foam to it and now it works well, but i suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place. 
this pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need. i would personally recommhe electro-harmonix metal muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price. 
it is entry level but only records one channel even though it is misleading with multiple inputs and outputs. it works as a beginner tool but only that. mono only. 
this was my first foray into home recording and it comes with audacityfor free. free is free, and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction . the interface is noisy, and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc. sent it back after one day. 
im starting a podcast. i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti. i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this. great for voice overs. in sound proof studios. the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise. the ability to select the 4 recording modes is great. if youll use it. i would not reccomecording 2 people at once on this. however recording a choir or something would work. but i will never do that and neither will you. this microphone only has a usb port. not XLR. so no hope of expanding. if you ever want to host a podcast with 2 people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and 2 new microphones.or you can do what i did and get 2 audio technica atr 2100's, 1 behringer xenyx 802 dual mic input mixer, 2 shock mount/broadcast boom combos and 2 windscreens for the same price as a yeti, raidus shock mount, the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand.now i can replace my mixer and keep my 2 mics, or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for 2 hosts on my podcast.do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever 
i normally tune to drop f on my 8 string, but even in standard, i just cant stand the strobe, and theres no other mode. i ordered a pitch black for $70. im still waiting on the return for this. 
the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand. the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing. sent it back and did not reorder. 
i ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated. however, the bag was ripped in 3 places. the stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing. the most annoying thing was that they did not match each other. the locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights. the holes in the inner poles were drilled in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height, you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height. they looked like they might be relatively solid but i returned them anyway...bit disappointing. 
both of the stands had parts that had fallen out, or were missing all together. when the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects, this is a major concern. it may be that i got a bad box that got missed by quality control, but it does make me suspicious of pyle products. 
the material used is fine. the looks are fine. the length is horrible. this is too short for most adults that play guitar. it felt like i was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders. i attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what i could use. to me this was a worthless purchase. i just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again. 
i got a few of these as a christmas gift and they're just bad. i put them on my pedalboard where i previously had longer cables and these just didn't stay in the jack. i have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these. if i play loudly and my room vibrates a bit, the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal. awful. 
so heres the thing that no one else wants to say. the thing is built like a piece of s . it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around. i used this 3 times and it shorted out. the lights started flashing and it got hot. i called line 6 and they determined it was bad so they opened a \"ticket\". fyi if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line 6. not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc i could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on. i wish i would have never bought this but hopefully i get a new one soon. well see how helpful they really are. 
i have always loved line 6. this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up. it went dead. i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead. i am sorry to say that i returned it. my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs.i am really disappointed. 
i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived. just to find out it wasn't WORKING!!! it is defective, and because i brought it to mexico, now i can't get a refund or a replacement.i will try to fix it through some local electrician or something. very dissapointing! 
one of the ball bearings designed to catch and lock the side mounted to the strap dislodged, and my very expensive f custom shop telecaster fell flat on the ground. 
sounded good. warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15. i rocked all night and loved the sound. next day i turned it on, my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out. i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well. i changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock. id like to see a real set of jjs, im sure one of them was a dud. 
i bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes i record, the notes don't basily...if you think your will cheat the big boys harps, youll be dissapointed quickly...these are little more than toys compared to $40 dollar harps, they feel cheap but have a decent sound ...i dont know if they will last, but to make harp noises without decent b... ill use these sparingly...jim 
i play harp with some some that i perform. i found that all of these harmonica's the note's are off and it's hard to play, i have g blues harp that i compared the g harp to and the notes were a little off. the c harp was terrible. that said the only thing i like about this order is the case. i going to see if i can return them for store credit. 
too thick, no flexibility. sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings. tried on bass too, again with less than satisactory results. 
the picks work well with bass, but they are just too thick to use with ukulele. the pics also shed easily, making your instrument dusty in no time. 
i guess the tension on these is more than my uke was used to and when i put them on the neck became severely bowed after a day or two. sounded lovely for the first hour, that's why two stars. granted my uke is one of the cheaper lanikais, if you have a better built uke it might be able to take these but i simply can't recommersonally. 
for any usable tones while playing live, the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp. direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring.I didn't like the recorded tones either, much rather preferred amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasn't an option.that being said, it is good for practice and song writing. used this for more than a year and finally sold it! that's the other thing with items like this, they lose value real quick once the next version comes out. 
s on amazon). i own other herc stuff, and it's all ideal, and for a few bucks more, i could have had that lifelong-use stand instead of this one. oh, well, for once, i got cheap. and got burned for it.all in all, not great, this tiny stand. one stand fits not all. perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand, but i think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments. you may think you can bhe lower forks, but it's hard to do, will require a vice, and if you see on the amazon pictures, the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves, so if you splay it out like it should be, you'll change the way it fits in the grooves, and thus it won;t work at all. it's just an imperfect design. my take on it, your mileage may vary. bye bye. 
at the time i bought, was $16. mine arrived broken, so it had gone back. reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken. not upset about that - stuff happens. it is just not a good stand. light construcion, unstable (topples easily) and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped. the 'protective' materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft, shiny runner like materail and it 'sticks' to my instrument's neck. so i pick up uke and i get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity. happened every time. yes, i tried out the stand even though broken, and it proved to be a bad choice. back it has gone. 5 stars to amazon's return policy, thouh! 
let me first start off with the sizing. when they say \"fits soundholes from 33.75\" - 35\"\ they really mean it.you are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 1/16\" smaller than the specifications.i know i did. my fri oscar schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well. the edges did not \"catch\" completely and it looks terrible.my classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole, it did not fit at all. you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard.the main issue is the sound.yes, it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming, slightly but enough to tell.however, it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes.fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before, even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes.for me, that does not justify it.a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less.another thing i found out was what was amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new.the packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened. does it matter? in practical terms, no, not for this sort of item.i guess that is how amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies. 
perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound. be advised that i did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike. as strictly an issue of natural acoustics, i found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar's output and resonance. i have an aria ad-80 which is a very well-made chinese attempt at cloning a martin d-42. it can not compete with the real Martin but for the money i paid it was a great buy and it is known as a \"sound canon\" for it's great natural volume. adding the o-port deadened the lows. it just didn't provide any plus at all anywhere else. it is however pretty inexpensive so if you're a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it's not going to break your bank. but again, if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person \"voiced it\" in his or her manufacturing process, this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything. i'm an acoustic nut and i'd love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box. the o-port seemed to \"corral\" the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole. sorry to be a crab about it--i like planet waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the \"humidipak\" recall a few years back. but this product was a waste to me. 
i thought it would protect my desk but the pad is almost like that rubber they put under rugs so they won't slip around. maybe i should get that for cheaper.i accidently bought large, ooh boy is it; like, windshield sun reflector size. sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose. 
there is a problem with the design. when you move the head, the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head, just break off. the tuner itself is great, but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes. 
for some reason, this one just doesn't hit the notes right. it looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway. i have tried it several times and it just doesn't tune right. then i recheck with my other brand and it's not even close. maybe i just got a bad one? i like that this one shuts off automatically..but again, it's way off tune.i did like the style, size and color.....but it doesn't work right so it's like running with a flat tire... 
i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item. it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together. the glue didn't hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel. this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund. warehouse deals are not such good deals. 
first time i tried to use it, it broke in my hand. it is now taped together, while i wait for a different kind to replace it. 
very accurate tuner but it broke within the first week i used it. the little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break ring it useless. i will try to get a replacement... now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need. 
like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off. i tried to glue it back on, but it just fell apart even worse when i tried to do that. if you buy this, you really need to baby it! my advice is look for a more sturdy model! 
tuner works great. both by vibration and mic.only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak. mine broke off... not even a year old. 
stopped working all by itself. fresh battery didn't help.fortunately, i've another, plus a korg and an two intellitouch. (i've 2 fiddles and 3 guitars)the intellitouch is simply \"champion!\". 
...what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss? my guitar i guess, but who cares? i honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else.a question to amazon: companies producing objects that are nothing else than a lemon shouldn't be prosecuted?p.s.i think it is \"too polluting\" for 'low cost' items to waste again in paper box, transportation, restocking work, refund work and so on. this is why 99% of the time i do not ask for my money back / but / sell this lemon on amazon, online with other websites, and in all the instrument shops worldwide in a total bad faith (while testing nobody in irig noticed the overwhelming hisssssssing?) well that is beyond me! 
no matter how many times i hard reset my 3gs, no success. there is no problem with my jack, and the phone is in pristine condition -- no problems until now. there is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work, but that's about it. i registered my amplitude app, and followed all of the instructions on the box. i tested the irig with an iphone 4 and was able to get it operating.i am giving this two stars because it did work on my fri iphone 4. but for my purposes with a 3gs, it is a brick. if anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation, i will re-rate the product. 
this is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iphone or ipad. but if you want to use it for any recording at all, even demos, i strongly recommoing for the irighd. the hd sounds waaaaaay better, and the build quality is great. this guy, not so much. there was always a bit of noise with my old irig, and it seemed to get worse over time. it also felt kinda fragile and chinsy. if you look, you can usually find the hd somewhere for $80; a $50 difference is significant, but the jump in quality (and likely longevity of the product) is definitely worth it. i upgraded and would absolutely do it again. 
bought this for a fricheap plastic enclosure. affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay. he tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay. stay away from this one and get a better used pedal. 
my review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more. when i first got it i liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first i thought it was great. then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.after all of that i finally realized i was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. go to the f forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.the thing happening with this amp i think is a few things. f guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a f, and i don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, i wanted anything but a strat body, unless i have a grand to pay for an older one, i'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and i would only get one after i got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people i've read the complaints i was trying not to realize, as i didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, but i did!and i am so glad i did. i almost got a peavey vypyr, and i am glad i didn't. this amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which i read on f's own forum/website, f acknowledges it exists, but does nothing to fix it in future models!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.i've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and i was like review s of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying \"throw away your pedals, you won't need them\" and \"i was going to get pedals, but don't need to now\ that's kind of the danger of these amps, they p making everyone sound the same! no matter what tweaking i was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.i think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and i've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but i needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.i think if i played this at a gc i wouldn't of gotten it, and i just tried to make myself like it. 
could be a fluke, but my unit was defective straight out of the box. plugged it into the macbook pro, fired up garageband and right away it's midi connectivity was intermittent. then it had some stuck notes. then it stopped being recognized at all. it still got power from the usb bus, but no MIDI, no sound. the jack was visibly wiggly, too.so, you're mileage may vary, but mine obviously had a defective usb port on the back. rather than bust it open and get soldering iron, i returned it and bought an m-audio oxygen 25 for $20 more. 
with drum pads, i basically either get 0 velocity, or max. and i have to really hammer on them to trigger. hurts after a while.likes:+ size+ assignable knobs.+ works good w/ ableton livedislikes:- drum pads!keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size.i'm looking to upgrade after a month.. want better drum pads. :-/ 
works as advertised but the keys are stiff. pads take too much presure to activate. nice that i dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop.after the first few uses the usb socket broke and fell off into the unit ring it useless. wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed. i had registered it with akai already so i complained to them and they sent me a new one. i had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product.not recommg this product. 
this unit might be great if you have child hands - the keys on the keyboard is soooo small.. don't get this if you have man hands! wtf u[date the description akai wtf 
a dull, inept version of a tubescreamer. just sounds flat and boring. not very inspiring. at all. (then again, i never did really like ts's)....... 
really wanted to like this one, because i loved the price. there is no way this is true bypass. the one i got was defective out of the box, and so when i checked, i saw the circuitry did not support pass through. maybe it is because i received a defective one, but i still wouldn't try this brand name. i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something. 
i honestly was not impressed. it looked cheap, sounded cheap, what else is there to say, you get what you pay for!!! another chinese copy of a tubescreamer, 
i can't say much about this product. i tried it twice. it seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings, but i really didn't notice any great change. the strings didn't sound betteer or brighter. now, it sits in my drawer and collects dust. maybe i will try it again at some point, but.... 
i honestly don't see the purpose. it doesn't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar. i've used it a few times, but don't see the benefit.edit 5/30/13:after coming back to read the other reviews, it's obvious what happened: this was shipped to me completely dry. there was no grease/lubricant qualities. it was like a dry erase pad. they need to improve their quality control. i'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star. they have to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.i would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn't dried out yet, to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out. 
the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes. i don\"t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time i used it. the cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and i lost sound. this cable is complete garbage. never again! 
i purchased this amp locally and initially, i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds. this was my first f amp as well.the presets were neat and all, but when i played around with some of the review s online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the f support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues. apparently, the mustang i and ii don't have these issues, and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp. is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? there is speculation that the lcd screen (which is not present on the i or ii) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and f doesn't seem to care...definitely try this before you buy it. you may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.this amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. i am disappointed that f hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that f reps say that know what is wrong, but i'm not taking that as a fact...), but they have acknowledged that there is \"something\" wrong.whatever... i took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and i picked up a 100 watt marshall instead. guess what? the clean channel has zero hum or buzz, even when cranked. how about that? even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise.i'll knock f for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that i'd like to try. but before i buy another f amp, i'll take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds. 
tc is very overrated.Many pedals i have out performs this in my opinion. the vintage bbds (mxr vintage delay, morley 70's echo) for example just take it. but for newer pedals i liked the mxr carbon copy and ibanex de 7 much better. 
it is ok as long as you don't bump your guitar, else boom, it hits the floor. i don't trust it and amazon has it way over priced. it will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place. 
a great idea, but pure crap in terms of functionality. if you don't have something heavy on the flat the rubber piece moves, and before you know it, your axe is on the ground. i saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight, but i'm not so hot with that idea, especially if the can is open. the lip need to extown longer, and something needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around. if i had a permanent place to mount this, i'd gorilla glue it down, but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and i'll get an extra guitar stand instead. good idea, but it doesn't work. 
i purchased this instrument brand new, on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that i simply could not ignore. it was brand new, unopened, in box. they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase. in that environment i thought it a nice instrument.however, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store, and that store was very busy and noisy. it's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.this is indeed a 6-string ukulele. it measures a bit over 28\ review . i know some will disagree. but others know exactly what i mean. this isn't an expensive instrument so one really can't expect super-fine quality at this price. however-- i paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom. as mentioned, the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and i was able to return it. i simply cannot recommhis instrument unless there are no better options-- and frankly, there are. 
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams...dr 05, dr 07 mk2, and dr 40 and, for myself, up buying nothing...their differences for your ears...are....dr 05, this is a good quality toy...no line in...use its own mic, you will be ok with this, for meetings, etc.not really that good for music...can be done, but not as good..if you use ext mic...u wont be happy either...high background hiss noise relative to all 3.dr 07etc etc...only slightly better than 05...all else same...dr 40 was much quieter in noise level...be it...in mic, ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars...this can be used to ( semi ) record music too.so, testing on their own mics...that last one was far far better than the first two...for those wantingline in...means only that dr 40...however,my tests involved checking sound quality of bit more seriouslive recordings...took output from our zoom r 24 recorder and input that to the dr 40...upon comparing the resulting cds...a / mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd, vs...b / recorded dr40 and printed to cd...the sound was obviously better with a /no need to buy any a/d recorder attempt at this price level ,if one is looking for semi serious master recorder...my budget must be tripled at least...and then to go out to test some more !no cheap way, is there....for those curious, the whole idea has come from wanting to connect 2 units of zoom r24, not wanting to use computer software, taking the 4 outputs from these two into a clean mixer or analog sum box, and getting them downto 2 channels, and finallly to some mastering digital recorder....hoping perhaps the tascam ss r100 or r200 might do the trick,in the tests to come....many thanks, and may your camels always have two humps !k 
i ordered one of these (from mf) and had to st back because it was damaged and the latches didn't all work. even in perfect condition it's still a subpar case. but the one i got had two ripped corners on the lid, and from those rips it's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around, and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing. as for the latches (buckles), there are three of them and on the one i had only one worked to keep the case closed. the other two latched, but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.disregarding those flaws it's still obvious that it's not a good case. the hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment, the handle is not comfortable to hold, and the whole thing bin a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag. it also won't stand evenly on if that's important to you).on the positive side it's light, it does fit a telecaster ok, and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment. but do yourself a favor and spnother $25 and get something better. i have a musician's gear dreadnought case and this doesn't compare to that one at all. 
right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was way off (fretted e note on the 12th fret too sharp). after the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. next, i proceeded to adjust the intonation. i was able to get the intonation for the a, d, g, b, and high-e strings spot on. however, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted e note on the 12th fret was still sharp.i also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string f the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string f the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-e string intonation.i love the red burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). unfortunately, i'm going to have to return it. i'm going to get a squier strat instead (with either amapleorrosewoodneck).---[update november 15, 2013]i ordered the squier strat direct from amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. i contacted customer service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until december. then, to my surprise, the squier strat was delivered yesterday! yay!! :d the happiness!!i was able to get the squier perfectly intonated. it's red burst like the legacy (f calls it antique burst). it's a beautful guitar and and i'm loving it! 
... "unixreviewtime": 1332806400, "reviewtime": "03 27, 2012"} name reviewer review just use a smartphone to record stuff. this is a really weird, not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones. not really worth the $75 - i returned mine. 
i was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time, good though they were. too expensive foronly one effect at a time. returned it. 
well... it's not really too expensive, but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it. even the crunch button is just a louder sound? not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you're looking for. guess that's why it's so cheap. 
it is built like a tank, but it quit working after a couple of weeks. i haven't made time trouble shoot it yet, so i'm not sure what component has failed. 
this product is bad quality because the noise it makes. it increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all. i'm going to sell this product. i didn't like it. 
downgrade to 1-o star after returning it back to brookmays, the seller:i am really disappointed by the seller, brookmays', ignorant responses to my return of the defective cherbub guitar pickup, which picks up unwanted noise by the wire's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won't have the same issue. after two weeks of the returned item was delivered, i didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so i emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap. too bad, four days after the email had been sent, i only got the email of telling me the case# of the message i sent without any further response to my refund. until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and i don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money i spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. therefore, yesterday, i emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to amazon about the bad after-sale service i ever have before if i still haven't heard from the seller shorty.today, i finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, review after using it twice:i like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings. besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description \"regardless the surrounding noises.\" i have distressed from those unwanted loud noises. one more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that i use, and i have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. however, when i switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either. i don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup i got ... i bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, i can't accept the noises and i have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. so, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, brookmays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description. good luck then! 
this is more of a toy than a good pickup. it functions but doesn't sound great. what did i want for this price anyway? 
first we have to realize this is not a $200 pickup or even a $50 pickup. it's less than ten bucks.it has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar. as such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole. it also will to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole, as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.it is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices. unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4\" to 1/4\" coupler (to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord). you will need such extension as this tto have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.it is a passive pickup, so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device. if you don't have a preamp system, this will do you no good.So because of the limitations i rate it as above. for what it does though-- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments, it does okay. i believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money, including adhesive-disk mikes. i would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from. but this is a slightly different concept (removable) that for the price is worth checking in to. 
i bought this to use on my f p-bass. it is not reliable for me, sometimes it works and sometimes it can't find the low note correctly. i'm still using my roland stomp box tuner. glad this was inexpensive, it was not worth the hassle to return, i gave it away. 
i am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments ... wanted to like this ... but ...first the positives:- looks great- nice, easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice pricenow the significant disappointment:- inaccuratethe settings were on a-440 but every time i tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing, the tuning was sharp ... i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... i have used the old planet waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since d'addario now owns planet waves products, they have discontinued the tuner i like and only offer the ns mini tuner (it has its place i guess, but i much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision imo) ...i haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now i will keep using my old planet waves models ...bottom line, no matter how nice the snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard a-440 ... having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation ... 
i own the sn-8, which btw, is the best tuner i've ever used. i bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin. so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin. i was also intrigued by the &#34;tighter&#34; tuning aspect of the bars on this. let me tell you, if it worked, the bars may have been a cool feature, but when you are fine-tuning an a string and it tells you you are on e (when you know you are on a bc the other tuners all say a, and it matches the piano), then there is a problem. i could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing, so it looks like it's just defective. the one i received was completely useless.I am amazed at the great sn-8...i am disappointed in this thing. i must have just received a dud (i hope, since these usually get good reviews), but i will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly. on the flip side, i will be getting another sn-8 in it's place, since i know those are great tuners & i love the one i already have. 
there is almost no difference between this and the snark sn-1, and by that i mean the design flaws. you have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading, and they eat batteries like crazy. the snark sn-8 is far superior. 
can't believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector. i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector. this is now a boat anchor. to buy a 3 meter cable from them, they charge $40 for the cable, $15 to ship it and then tax. the extortion here is almost monster cable like. these folks should be embarassed. 
this gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an ipad or iphone or a computer, but the particular one i received has a defective input socket for a 1/4 inch audio plug. it doesn't snap in place. just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out. that makes it fairly useless. i may have simply gotten a defective one. 
what was thought to be a doa model,  up being a mistake on my behalf. my iphone 4s, which i have had for about a year now, must've had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine...unless trying to use the jam.in the box: comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps.it comes with the jam and two cables (usb and ios). it is bigger than i had imaginedit's almost the length of an iphone. feels nice, and is very light. the cords aren't very long. 
the velcro itself is insanely amazing. its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing. if you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men, then by all means, use this stuff. in the you just can't make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board. once together, it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably. i cannot think of a practical application for this velcro. 
i tried this in front, in the middle, and at the f an effects chain, as well as by itself, plugged into the effects loop of my mesa boogie mark v amplifier. whenever it is in the path, as soon as i engage my effects loop, the signal level drops considerably. it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not. the chorus effect is good, but i don't want my volume to drop every time i turn on my effects loop. i have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that i use, so i can't raise the sny more. 
the hde xlr to usb is ubs. i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome. i learneda long time ago dont try to fixsomething you paid for st back. so i did thanks hde for wasting my time. go sell your snake oil to someone else.....i 
this cable was very affordable, but you get what you pay for. it sounded brilliant while it wasn't broken, for about the 4 hours of runtime. it works if it isn't abused at all, but if you abuse it in any way at all, your out an xlr cable. i do not recommhis product at all for heavy usage. 
well... its a stand.. its super cheap and i don't mean the price. the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back.. i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back. its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well. instructions were ok.. came with more parts than what were required... all holes filled and i have of of each part extra.. the guitars do not sit very well in this stand... i will use it until i can find a better one.. it will get replaced.. i really should shis pos back to amazon. the concept is great but the execution of it sucks. it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand.. there are better options out there for something portable. this stand is worth 10 0 tops... if i had it to do all over i would save my money. 
this stand is ok for light home use. i would not recommhis thing for gigging or travel. very cheaply made but does the job. guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot. you must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on the rack. avoid if you can spore. 
i really like epiphone products. they are well-made, easy to play guitars. i also purchased an ep les paul special 2 ebony from amazon a while back. but, i received this uke defective. i expected when i plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but i couldn't here anything at all. totally dead. there are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down. i'm disappointed because i expect gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory. i actually bought this guitar for a frind was very embarrassed when i got over to his house and it didn't work in front of him. i just requested a return/exchange from amazon. if the next one works ok i may buy a second one for me. i seem to have bad luck with electric-acoustic guitars when purchased through amazon. i had to sack my dean 12 string elec-acoust to amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem. i do want to state that this is a beautiful uke with nice feeling nylon strings, fine wood high polished surface, high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically. the actual guitar looks even better in person than in the picture. if this uke was working 100% i would have given it a 4 or 5. 
i sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and i see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap, but i don't know why. maybe other people don't really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before. it wasn't too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds, but once i got it on it was stiff and felt odd. it was very uncomfortable around my neck and i took it off my guitar in a matter of matters. i would honestly recommpg a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap. unless you're just going for something that is inexpensive, does the job, and isn't designed for comfort. 
i ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap, the first one arrived in non working condition, wires inside werent even soldered, so i ordered a replacement, plugged it in and it didnt work either, the second wasnt soldered either.i know its cheap, but i expected it to at least work, do not buy 
it was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china. any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell. if you can wait a month for delivery or longer, if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up. if you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too. i have decided to build my own 
it did not perform. looks cool, but thats it. very large and inconvenient. would not recommhis because i would not recommhe blue yeti. 
this is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there. i play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen. it worked but i don't use it anymore. 
compared to the snarksnark sn-1 tunertuners, i really like the low profile / leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. the snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. this works much better in that regard. this one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. it mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine. tuning accuracy? hard to say- it just indicates high / low / on pitch, really. i prefer the more precise and wider scale +/1 readout of the snark. they are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. but this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.the negatives, and why i can't recommt are as follows. the battery cover on mine fits very loosely. i worry the battery will fall out very easily. i may p gluing it in place. it isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up i think). the second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpular to the user- that's right, sideways. on a bass, i don't really need it to tell me which string i'm plucking or tuning, but i still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it. it wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow. i just can't for the life of me work out why they designed it this way. 
the device itself is difficult to read in bright light.my first one arrived not working at all.the second one arrived with a low battery. what? after three days the battery goes out.i would have returned it, but lost it because it doesn't adhere to the headstock very well. you've been warned. 
50+ years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless 
i bought this with the idea i was getting a pedal that would give me usable marshall amp sounds. after trying for a couple of hours, i find that it won't do that. i guess my combination of guitar and amplifier wasn't meant to be used with this pedal. the guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control, he was spot on about that (very annoying effect). nothing but praise goes to the supplier ( kdm distributors) . they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country. but the pedal itself, not for me. 
wow, the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry, but plug in some real mics and voila- the dr-40 becomes something special.... but, i do not always want to carry around so much equpment, and was hoping for better internal mics.honestly, my super cheap olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing.and why is the line-out so darn noisy!? must be defective. oh well... gonna, have to shis back. 
.the 2i2 is a simple set-up. pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a \"low-headroom\" instrument to it, run the usb cable to your computer and set it up within the daw described parameters. it would have been nice to know that the included plug in suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with ableton live lite and that it could be found it in the plug-ins section of ableton, but i figured it out eventually regardless. (ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!i wasn't sure for a very long time if this was user error, an ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, i screamed \"ballsdogit!!!\ and purchased a license for reaper. after going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new daw over the last few months, i began to realize that my monitors no longer \"lock up\ but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!i had to tweak the living daylights out of reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. now i'm in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers. garbage focusrite! everyone i know that has reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. i have yet to experience a crash, but i also have yet to experience any recording time.seriously, i started reading on the reaper forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from david@focusrite actually saying that \"you should not use this setup to record electric guitar..\ and that if you need to record electric guitar you should \"get something with more headroom like the 2i4.\" that is just unbelievable in my eyes!i'm sure i could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should i have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? besides that, i'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. there was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and i researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. i feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. how in the heck does this thing have a nearly 5 star rating!!!????the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. i have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. i constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the focusrite scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here. 
hi folks! ok, this thing is cheap. that's cool. but a cheap item you can't use is money thrown away. before buying this i had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it's too small. well, i want to clear this up once and for all. it is too small! specifically, it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so (depg on your guitar), and it doesn't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret, even on a skinny neck. this thing really is a puzzler. i mean, who the hell would make capos this size, especially when they could've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price? someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid. however, a positive from this whole mess is that i finally found a capo to use with my ukulele, and for way cheap, ha ha. but if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size, this is utter garbage. cheers! 
this isn't a terrible tuner, and for how cheap it was, it wasn't a \"ripoff\". however, it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim. when it does work, it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner. however almost all of the time it's fluttering around to completely different notes or just not reading a single thing. i try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and it's the same. it also did not come with batteries, and replacement ones aren't cheap and are very hard to find. i don't think this is a terrible product due to the low price, but if you want to be taken seriously and take your own music seriously, get a real desktop tuner. a cheapo one is only 5 bucks more and you can find real, full sized, affordable batteries for it... 
tried this and was not happy. seemed to want to be off too much. got the f ft-004 instead. this one does have a great view on the led, but if it doesn't tune right, what's the point? i would try the f. just a note. if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner. i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing. just a thought. 
i have had 2 of these tuners (you'd think i'd learn after one). they calibrate okay , it's just that they to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device (both of mine broke this way). to me, for the price, it's made cheaply. try d'addario instead; love their tuners. 
i know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here. the unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a rode m1 mic or similar.i knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot, but i opened one, tried to use it and can't. it was a total waste of money, but doesn't pay to return it. i suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it, it might serve your purpose. again, you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands. 
the adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap, a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately. replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand. they are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting, good enuf okay i guess. but after transporting and reset, i found them to be junk. 
big disappointment. i've been so impressed by epiphone's but this one didn't do it. quality of manufacture and assembly great. pickups far less than inspiring. yes, it's a great platform but was so expecting those p90 sound. i may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it. just didn't have the tone and bite i was expecting.i could certainly invest in some pup's but i have too many great p90 guitars to bother. roll of the dice i guess. 
installed these on my schecter c-1 hellraiser. i had very high hopes for these, but as with any new over-hyped technology, they failed to impress me. the only good thing i have to say is the tone is good. but realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings. you would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison. so now that i have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse. they are not silky smooth feeling as advertised. if anything they feel worse than regular strings. last but not least: they are bad for frets. just like stainless strings; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick. i don't know about anyone else but i don't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.for the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear. 
kripes man..the one time i go and actually buy a \"honer\" and its a \"bummer\" this thing has 3 keys off tune!! i can buy stuff 10 times better quality from chinaand never have this kinda junk. maybe it's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and i 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan ive never got a harp this trashy b4!...... all i can say is buy merana's for tryin out buy \"suzuki\" or swan\" from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you'll be better off. oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again--- you can get a \"mississipi river harp\" for only $5.oo if you have a \"burke's\" outlet near you!they're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho---- the doctah has spoken! :) 
not really bright enough. both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same. i would look for something else if i didn't already have this. ok for reading a small book in bed, but doesn't cover the sheet music brightly enough. 
i bought this brand because i have one of their mic stand mounts (for iphone) which i like a lot.pros:the clips did a good job holding my ipad mini without having to remove the folio type cover (marware axis).quality seems acceptable for the price, the ball swivel works well.cons:it's too heavy for my mic stands. i tried it on the boom arm and it made it top-heavy and unstable. if the boom is positioned in a very upright position it's ok, but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose!the clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome.i had high hopes for this one but it's not going to work for me. i have returned it and ordered a different chargercity model, the one with the lever-type mount. 
this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside. upon receiving mine and assembling it, it broke immediately while i was trying to mount an ipad onto it. it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability. the metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle. 
first time using item and it broke. the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke. i was really excited to have this and us it now that i transferred all my music sheet to my ipad. as soon as i took it off the mic stand the round piece came off. would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review, but it only kept referring to delivery. i do like the product and it did hold my ipad steady even with a leather case on. sad! 
this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima ,not the product. these people posted what seemed like a good price (not ridiculously low) on the us dream pedal. it was to be shipped from japan. they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order. this kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on amazon.com because the item was less than $4 0 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers yorozuya yokoshima were afraid they wouldn't make a killing on the item. i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior. i lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident. 
a very boring, dull, uninspiring pedal. don't waste your time with this. a boss sd-1 or digitech bad monkey are far better options for this price range. 
i've owned more than one overdrive pedal in my 30 years of playing guitar and the only one i still have on my pedal board is the boss super overdrive...sweet baby is well on the way of living up to that legs well. i have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal. it really does react to your playing style. unlike other overdrive pedals i've used this one really gets smooth when you back off of your string attack and starts to growl the harder you dig in. as far as the pedal goes it is pretty much the same as a lot of them...instead of a tone knob they call it \"focus\ there is also a volume and drive knob. the sounds i can get out of the sweet baby are some of the best i've ever used and easy to dial in. i own a lot of pedals but lately i keep my chain setup real simple...the guitar goes into a ehx-crying tone wah pedal, then the sweet baby, then a boss super overdrive (used as a lead solo gain boost... i don't use distortion pedals.), next is an mxr micro chorus followed by an mxr carbon copy analog delay. the whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my f deluxe reverb amp. i use the foot switch that came with amp to turn on the tremolo when needed... i play mostly blues and classic rock. the sweet baby is well made and i don't see it failing me anytime soon. you can spundreds more on name brand pedals but what works for me at the f the day is alive and well in this \"clone\" overdrive tone bl...update: this pedal has since been returned. it went out with me on a few gigs and didn't hold up to life on the road. the connections inside the box came loose and became a major problem before a few gigs...i have since put my boss super overdrive back in the chain...while i truly loved the tone from this product in the ou get what you pay for. 
let me just start out by saying that i've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. i still own most of these units except for this one...the joyo compressor. my setup is a very simple one...starting with a stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah, super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front f a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. i don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals i've tried over the years but i know why you want one and how to use them. this thing simply didn't work right out of the box. while the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from china. loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. i  up sg it back for a full refund. i don't in anyway blame the seller. they took care of me without a hitch and i would buy from them again...just nothing with the name joyo on it. if you're only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for. 
the unit i received did not work. i returned it. i like the other joyo pedals i ordered so i am going to give this one another shot. 
although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked, the attack knob (the control for how much compression you want to apply) did absolutely nothing. i even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting.perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one, but none-the-less i returned the pedal back to amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board. 
it seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp. not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk. when received the package did not appear to be damaged, but i have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument. 
can't hold tightly on 1st string (low c), a little buzz. 
update: received 6 of these. 5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer. it was held by only one small tac weld.i got what i paid for. cheap price and cheap product. no excuse to make this kind of low quality guitar stand, putting a $500 guitar on this is asking for guitar damage when the stand falls apart. not worth the time & $ to st back to amazon. one star only for this product. good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this. less than one star for this piece of ...... 
this is a cheap stand and i was not surprised to see it had broke less than 2 day after it had arrived. the top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made. i do not recommhis product. 
i dont know what all the hype is over this thing. the idea is good and its cute. its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out. how many of these types of noise boxes do we need? not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it. go buy a 20 watt roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also. or any combo little amp. it's for bedroom use only. you have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire. being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you. just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot. 
i have checked this amp out twice, once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 8&#34; version, with both a strat and a les paul, and i am very disappointed in this amp.now admittedly, with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre-amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 5-7, however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones.so, without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing...bottom line: unless you want full on distortion 100% of the time, you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp.... if you are committed to orange (and boy do they make some stunning amps) go check out the dark terror... 
when i originally went out to place this order, i was planning to order the tc electronics singles voicetone c1 vocal effects processor for its pitch correction function. as i looked over that device and some alternatives, i finally ordered the tc-helicon mic mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects. i ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect - how could tc electronics put out the &#34;mic mechanic&#34; with a pitch correction function that didn't do anything? well, those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has no EFFECT! also, i couldn't see any effect between engaging/disengaging the tone button. i kept the mic mechanic because i like the other effects, but i'm very disappointed in the primary reason i bought it! 
if you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static, non-oscillating, chorus like effect, it's fine for that. as an actual pitch shifter though, this thing is awful. all the pitch shift settings sound like they're 30 cents sharp. this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect. i suppose i could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but i did not want to void the warranty so i just returned it. it's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is. i've read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also. this is really too bad because all the other pedals for mooer seem to be quite good. i own their reecho delay pedal and quite like it and i'm also tempted to get their green mile pedal.if you're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies, this pedal maybe fine for you but i doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals. it does not stick to the adhesive on any of the velcro strips i've tried to use. 
i got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue: when i record a track either with the review after doing a few recordings. but, i would say if you've just updated to ios7 or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit, you might want to hold off on that upgrade. update: got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my ipad, as suggested by a focusrite support tech, and still have the problem i discussed above. so, this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me. if anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution, please let me know. 
no manual. you can print one off the internet but it should come with one given it's price. i purchase such so i could lay down a rhythem track then go into the solo while attempting to play live. don't believe this is what it is mean't for. a simple delay looper will suffice. this can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs. 
for the price i can hardly complain, but unfortunately the item was not the correct size for a f strat replacement. checked it against my american standard, mim strat and squier and it would not fit any of them. should have just used one of my dog's chew bones and cut it myself, would have been more accurate. 
i have been using this gig bag for the past few months. if i do the math, i probably didn't use it more than 10 times, basically from home to the subway, from the subway to the studio and back, so maybe 20 minutes walk each time. so i used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes, mostly carrying it on my shoulders, sometimes by one of the two handles.then the side handle started coming apart: the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used. it will be ok for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking (which i kind of expect at this point!). meanwhile i'm going to buy another (sturdier) gig bag.save your money and get something better than this. 
this thing is crap right out of the box it had holes in the stitching and all the pockets were sown on crooked. what can you expect for $20 tho. this was a temporary solution i don't recommhis for long term use it will probably fall apart. 
manufacturer's website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar. i have an esp eclipse. not even close. chromacast products are great. they need to fix the info on their web page. i'm not a fan of shaped les paul cases. too bad. 
returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it. not durable! sp few more dollars, it is worth it. 
a great little package for the price, but unfortunately, the zipper failed the first time i tried zipping it up. i have a standard size acoustic guitar, but be aware, the fit was snug, but not tight. 
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap. no directions inside or on the box. i messed with it for about 5 minutes. i would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic. i read the description but it did not say cheap. live and learn. 
amazon and tc electronics will not tell you that you need a 9v power supply. i didn't see any warning or advise in the point of purchase, nor in the package. this is an unfair practice from amazon and tc electronics. 
ever...my first \"less-than-5-star-review\" ever...same as others, switch failed less than ten days of owning it. used less than ten times total, light use at home, i wasn't even wearing shoes! by the way, a gigging/recording musician for over 25 years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff. bummer too great idea....poorly executed.i will not buy anther one. i will not recommo other musicians. 
soooo bummed. i simply love the sound on these cans, but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface (not deep enough in the cups) and press down hard on my ears. the max time i can wear them is like an hour, and then i can't wear them for a day or so due to residual pain. i guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups, that might help. also, on most of my other phones, the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces, while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet. so it's kind of like double trouble. however, these really do have great sound (especially the tight bass clarity). if it weren't for the discomfort factor, i would be using them all the time. as of now, i hardly use them at all. in fact, when i first tested these out, i was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more. but i'm glad i waited to really give them a more prolonged test. of course, we are all of varying shapes and sizes, ha ha, so they might work for you where they don't for me. if so, you've got a bargain on some great cans. if not, ouch. cheers! 
i love tascam gear, and have used it for nearly 30 years. i was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do. unfortunately, i was disappointed.while the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good, the actual function with the computer left much to be desired. also, the complete lack of a manual with the one i got made it very difficult understand the functions. (sorry, but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 cds of software, how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install cd?)there was a very small quick start guide included, which basically just named the various switches, inputs, and outputs, and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen. i was forced into trial and error to see if i could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode. i could not. i could record and layer multiple tracks (i was using audacity, didn't want to install cubase), but i could not get playback from the previous tracks while i also had live input. now this could have been my computer or audacity, as it is an older win xp machine, but it played back multiple tracks without problem.there was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this, or even hint where one should look, other than going to tascam's web site. i'm sorry, but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive. there should be a complete manual, at least in pdf, included with the product. if i am going to use this to do serious recording, the last thing i want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website, or worse, from \"user community\" threads in some blog.which brings me to another minor complaint - no Linux drivers included. i use mostly linux, with only one windows machine for software which i can't get on linux. i wanted to try the software under wine on linux but was under time constraints.then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware. with a hardware mixer, i can access as many controls as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time. computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time, and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls. the controls on this interface were very fussy, and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react. i found it very tedious, and again, no actual instructions were included to help with that process. with a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case? (yeah, i know, touch screens are cool.)also, software based functions are always limited by your computer and os, and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain.i am old school, and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful. i know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers, and saving space, etc., etc. i value function over fashion, however, and that is what i have always liked about tascam gear: it was supremely functional. this software falls far short of what i expect from tascam, and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable.good mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. the layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first, and takes some time to get comfortable with. old tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording, which was helpful to aspiring recording artists. not so here.i had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars, but sadly, it only rates a 2 (2.5 if i could) for me. come on, tascam, you can do better than this. 
the concept of this guitar stand is great, and i thought it would be perfect for my two telecasters...that is until i get the stands in place and put the guitars in them. the stands have a very deep angle, and from what i could tell, the guitars were sitting about 40 to 45 degrees back.it just looks silly, like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand, or are in a slow-motion fall backwards. it also up taking up way too much space, as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes. i  up returning these stands, but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version. 
cheap. the best way to describe this stand. it serves it's purpose but sp few shekels more on a better guitar stand. 
the tascam th-2000 headphones are like putting a pair of studio monitors on your ears! they are great! excellent bass response (not muddy at all), tight mids, and clear highs. to boot, they are extremely comfortable as well. the foam fits nicely around your ears, conforming to the contours of your face. they are adjustable, so if you have a huge head you can still wear these. the only drawback that i can see, and i don't really even consider this a negative, is the coiled cord. some people may not like that. all in all these are great headphones - i have listened to all varieties of music with them, monitored recordings with them, etc... excellent! by the way, they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background, making the music come out clearer. kudos to tascam for making such good headphones!may 12, 2014 update these headphones quit working after just a few months of working properly. i have a couple pair of inexpensive behringers that have lasted through more abuse and are still working. what a disappointment!!! 
i purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my roland gr55 (which has a flawless basic looper built in, but only 20 seconds record and no undo). i had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that i wouldn't need to carry a power adapter along.the factory battery lasted about 1 hour. the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes. i started recording a loop with another (3rd) fresh battery (tested 9.10 v with a multimeter) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording, suggesting that it was faulty. the lights started coming on and off randomly (record/undo/all three together, then off, then undo on, then all three on etc. etc.)the first time i used the jamman xt (with the factory battery) it seemed to be working ok and all i can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.i am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything, so i know it was not my poor technique. the main problem was that it didn't matter how hard i tried (even if i did a manual fade out) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the f the loop and the start. this makes the unit useless.also, it is poorly conceived in that, to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.the potential for damage here is very high. also, replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board. to save a few dollars digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible (read inevitable) damage.i have owned quite a few digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.it's going back to the store where i purchased it. 
i really wanted to like these, but they're a frickin, lint-catching sticky frickin' mess! they went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a new york minute, have never seen the light of day, and may have been thrown in the garbage. save your money. we use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now. 
the larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so i thought this might be the answer. the answer is to treat your larger snarks nicer cause this thing on the back of your guitar with no adjustments simple doesn't cut it. i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display. i'm quite disappointed and it sits here with no use. it is cheap though. still to me it was money out the window. 
the tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo i've ever used - and i've tried many over the years. but what was ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem, including the pick clip and tuner holder, protude outward away from the fingerboard? it's awkward to apply and remove quickly. it's visually distracting for player and audience, and it doesn't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.the only possible justification i can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck - but even that doesn't fly. regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and, unless you're avoiding playing that first fret (or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position) you're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand. i own the older planet waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.otherwise the construction of the ns artist capo is superb. the surface is arched, probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various strat fingerboards as well as a flatter sg/lp style. it doesn't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my martin om-1 which is virtually the same as a classical. if i cranked the tension it's possible the rubber would flatten out but i wouldn't risk marring the neck wood.i tried both the pick and tuner clips and they're functional, but to be honest i wouldn't use either - too distracting and i only use tuners to get an initial a, then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments, depg on what they are.the only other capo i've ever used that protudes outward is the kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence' design. i have one and, as good as the holding action is, i've never felt comfortable with the design. the older planet waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.to top off the confusion, the picture on the front of the cardboard card the ns artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that's impossible with this capo! 
i am a fan of planet waves ns capos, but this new one is not very well designed. the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards. i find my left hand hitting the lever when i'm in open position. frustrating. it does have a pick holder, which can be handy, and a place to put an ns tuner, which can also be handy. i just think it could have been better designed. i don't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff. i'll stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser. 
i was looking forward to trying these, as i've loved this company's product since day one.but i think they've messed around with the gauge, slapped a meaningless &#34;hd&#34; tag on, and added a few bucks to the price. more profit in someone's pocket for marketing jargon.i have a smaller-bodied guitar, so these should have, by their claim, given me better balance, but imho, the opposite happened. the bottom dropped out, the top topped sizzling, and the middle strings totally took over when i strum with a pick.when i play with fingers it's better, but not worth spg more money on than the normal 12s i've been using (which i think i liked a lot better).it's possible that these work great on the taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for (color me skeptical), but i'd say if you're happy with what you have, you need not try these.again, long-time user and big fan, but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly &#34;hd&#34; moniker... no thanks. 
i bought this to use with my keyboard. i wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. it doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what i'd always used. doesn't have the same feel either. nowhere close.in my opinion, a sustain pedal like the m-audio sp-2 sustain pedal with piano style action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. the price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. the only thing i've found the yamaha fc-5 sustain pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where i keep my electric guitar pedals. 
i didn't expect this cable to be so thin. it's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable i've used. not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference. if i had the foresight i'd sp couple extra bucks on a thicker cable. still, it works and was inexpensive.edit: 6 months later and it's dead already. wire frayed at the right angle jack. you get what you pay for. 
it hums, crackles, and i think i'm having problems with my equipment. as soon as i use any of my other cords then the problem is gone. hosa makes some other products that have good value. but based on my experience i don't recommhis one. 
i'm a pro-cheapo and i hated this thing. they're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. drop few more bucks and get something else! 
i bought this for my canon vixia hf g10 video camera and a shotgun mic that i recently purchased for it. i needed a 12&#34; wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic (which is mounted on the mini advanced shoe) to the microphone plug on the video camera...the wire on this thing is not 1 foot long. the actual wire is under 8&#34; long itself. i would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... i'd have rated it 1 star, but i tried it on my nikon d3200 (shoe mounted shotgun mike) and it worked out ok. still a tight fit though (since there's only 8&#34; of wire)...i'd recommnyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.also, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but i hear a hiss when recording. again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the dslr or not (or my shotgun mic). 
i got 3 of these to plug xlr cables into the 1/4&#34; jacks on my board. i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs. none of them work. perhaps i got the wrong thing? 
received it in time, standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days. since i was out of 30 days return time, sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today. 
these things are terrible. one wouldn't fit in my soundboard, another wouldn't lock in my mic. plain and simple....if your looking for crap that doesn't work....buy this. 
the handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and i feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. it's cheap and easy to use. it'll do the job, but i don't like it. 
it's good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price 
the epiphone les paul guitars don't particularly sound that great, but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price. if your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar, but you're not completely sure if they will stick with it, if you can spnother $100 and get a used mexican made f strat or tele. the reason for this is because for 1, if they decide it's not something they want to do anymore, you can resell it at the same price you bought it for (as long as it is still in decent condition) and little no money is lost. second, if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a &#34;better&#34; or more high uitar, mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. i have a couple different high uitars and i will not get rid of my mexy strat because it sounds great still. i'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this. 
this is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, you want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it. why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me. this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hx would use. boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.these things are built with heavy metal, it should last, i kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion 
from greg abrams review, entitled review is to give newer players some information. you have plenty of options for distortion pedals, the ds-1 is not the only thing out there that's affordable. find something you truly love and buy that. if its the ds-1, one of the pedals i've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to you. 
here's the deal with this pedal. it is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. in my opinion, for spg less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the mxr badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it. 
if you want your guitar to sound like eddie van halen, joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a boss gt-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. search google for boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. 
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg. all the other guitars i own have schaller buttons on them and i have one main strap i use for all of the guitars. i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out. not twenty min later i was removing them and putting schaller buttons in their place. here the 3 major reasons i did not like them over schaller:1- bulky. they stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- problems engaging. i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. it wasn't until i forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- cheap. they just feel cheap. thin metal is used in comparison to the schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.for a few bucks more i'll stick with schaller's. i have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail. 
. once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. so if you are stuck with a set, here's what i recommo to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1\" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (they are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)put the screw into an electric drill (pointy n) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. it doesn't need much. i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. while you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.install with the new screws as normal, and recommhat your fritry a different brand! 
sorry, i don't like these as they're just too big. they stand out too much. they do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. there are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap. again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. i also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like i should be wearing big purple platforms when i play. not cool. 
the thing is that they don't seem to stay! i mean, you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic &#34;arm&#34;, but it doesn't stay where you put it. and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality. but, i think if you're lucky if just might get the job done. 
i purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. i would have returned it but i completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed). 
wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is much better...avoid this!! 
i ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? i ordered it \"new,\" and it definitely shows signs that it not new. first, the package was stapled, that's right- stapled together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. when i order something new, i expect it to be new. based on this product alone, i would not recommuying from this seller. 
well, what can i say? based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. however, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. the cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). and before you ask, &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;, all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. so it is definitely the cable :(anyway, i gave it 2 stars because while it was working it sounded great through my roland jc120. 
as the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. if you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. i purchased it for that reason...and i'm an adult, so i can be careful. this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. it will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.there are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason i gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price. 
i got this for my boss loop station, but it doesn't work very well. i keep hoping i'll find something it does work well with... 
that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. i bought the .90 gauge at guitar center and love them. these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound. i don't know if i will use these forever but for right now i love them. just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.buy em!!!! 
long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. so when my strings wear out, i got this. now i feel like playing an emg bridge on my f/archtop's neck position, without the power that an emg pickup has to offer. yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like seagulls...bottom line, i recommhis string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. if you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string. 
i've been playing guitar for over 40 years, and these tortex picks are nearly the worst i'v ever used. they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity-clack noise. dunlop ultex picks sound much better. 
i can't hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them. better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast 
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase. 
to a great brand like dunlop. let's hope this is just a short-term fluke. 
it's simple, basic, but i don't think it does that good of a job. this is because it doesn't really humidify that much and doesn't extery far into the guitar. 
this product is not what it seems. it has a cool name, but that's about it. it's a tool oil that stinks. i tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. after doing away with the fast-fret, my playing has improved and i hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. i now use old english and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. you will too... 
not a great mic, but if you need something realitively cheap, it'll do. limited dynamic range. but, it works. wish i'd have gotten something a little nicer though. 
it just randomly pops off my bass, it's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down. i hate it. 
years ago i used the clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. i couldn't tell from the picture, that these were full size, and i didn't check the size in the description. i still had a few of the small ones, so i used them as templates, to cut these down. i would have rated them higher, if i could have used them as is. it's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. i purchased two six packs of clayton teardrop picks, but found dunlop 423r60 0.60mm (orange) tortex small tear drop guitar picks, 36-pack which are a lot cheaper. 
this is a basic eq pedal, that is a bit noisy in my testing. even when running on battery power, there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs. 
i don't like the feel or sound of these strings. i bought both the 10 and the 11 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil. i would not buy these again 
it is not the size for mini guitar. may be for the big one...connections are shaky. you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low. 
total flimsy junk. it leans wayyy too far back. i'll be damned if i put my $1000 guitars on these things. on the other hand, chromacast makes one that's very close to this price, and i doubt that it could have been more for the money i paid.in summary... do not BUY this piece of junk. 
...for something, but not a guitar. wasn't sure what to do with it so i now use it to mount a large cookbook, or notepad computer, so i can follow a recipe. it seems to work okay for that. just don't use this for guitars. an electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far, and the arms have no grip. this thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project. it may even give you aids! but probably not. however, animals could have been harmed in the making. but most likely, and in reality, it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner. 
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder. thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par. you'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips. 
the wire clipper and winder work o.k., but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn't slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out. bad design by someone who doesn't use it to pull pins out of a bridge. i p using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out. i've done it successfully for years. 
header says it all. works well enough as a string winder, but i was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me, this did not work well at all. went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle. 
i honestly really didn't find this thing useful at all. first, the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesn't open easily (very stiff action), so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick. and as for the winder... i suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. but it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything i used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help. didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing. just looked at it... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.each time i have set out to use it, i p turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string. i just recently  up buying a set of crescent brand miniature cutters & needle-nose pliers set(the pliers are just the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding). when i have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar, i'll try the notch bridge peg puller. but other wise, this thing gets a serious two-star &#34;meh&#34;. 
i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recomm at the music store. put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic 12 string. have 2 problems with the strings. first, the bass e (11th string) broke while tuning it up. had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not elixir). i have changed strings many, many times, so i am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the e string itself. second, the high D (8th string) seems \"dead\"; it does not \"ring\" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets i've used). considering these strings cost much more than others, i certainly am disappointed in them. hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good. 
i bought a set as they were recomm to get the tone i was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. installed as usual and tuned them. they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. my capo could not even hold them. i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. when i looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. i released the tension on all the strings as fast as i could and left it. i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. use at your own risk!!!!!!! i personally wouldn't give a nickel for them. 
not two weeks after i put these on the a string broke close to the ball on the string. i break high e strings on occasion. but something as thick as an a string?? maybe it was a defective string as i thankfully bought two sets and i was able to pull the a out of the other set and it has been fine since. now however i have the dilemma of should i just buy more strings and just use the second set as i need them. further more do i stick with the same brand. that is supposed to last longer than average strings. at this point i am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there. i will update once i decide if i should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky'supdate 3/25well another month went by(a week ago) and the d string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe i either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be. either way its losing another star. if it happens with a different set of strings i will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly 
i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic, which i was pretty happy with. for my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn't have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings. i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and i was right. i put a pair of d'addario xl 9.5 (highly recomm for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings. i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently. don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of d'addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings. 
looked like the chrome was cheesey and they  up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position 
did not hold the strings down very well for me... i love the feel of it, but the spring needs more power. 
this is an update to my original review because i have now fully tested two of these capos. i'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here. i'm not sure how it's possible. i've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim dunlop capos. i had purchased two, which i have now given away to student players as i cannot use them. i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar. the e string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. both capos had this very same problem.when i received these capos, i noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual jim dunlop capos. the craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official jim dunlop capos. the rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product. as a professional musician, i need to purchase reputable brand-name products because i can't afford to have my gear failing during performances. i have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation. when i contacted the seller, they were not honest with me. 
i know many people love the design, but i find it much too frustrating. you have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly, then snap it in, then turn and turn the screw, oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw. then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again. what a farce. this is the worst capo i've owned, and i've tried nearly every brand and type. yeah, i've had people show me how to do it right, and i know to do it right. it's just wrong to have to spo much time slipping it on, snapping it, screwing it in, screwing it off, having it fall off, forget it, it's garbage to me. also, while i'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day, the last thing i want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw. it's actually slightly painful to the fingers (momentarily, but why have to deal with that??) to work with. this design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it. the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable.no thanks. 
i bought this hoping to use as int, angled into guitar & straight into mixer, wrong, have to use it the other way around ... sad! 
only lasted 2yr. i have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it. 
could not get to fit small sound hole. once in sound hole pickup did not work at all. would not buy it. 
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. one was in the skb f case ($99.95 on amazon), the other in this gator case purchased locally. i was told it was just as good as the f case. both  up in checked luggage. after 1 flight from florida to lax and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up. the padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case. neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, i just ordered another skb f case. the gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips. the skb fs will be my airline cases from now on. 
i don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school. when you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.it'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. i just don't like the features of this stand at all. 
i've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting. this one is the worst. the plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle. bad...just bad.secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp. it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement. after twisting on it twice i stripped it out. now the thing is worthless. i'm returning it asap.i would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing. do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6\" pop filter. if you don't, you'll wish you did. 
not happy with the sellers description or the product. the description says \"heavy duty\" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic mic clip, but it's not. it's rubber!!! it sucks. used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and i can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. it's flexible!!! who uses flexible mic clips?!!! make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead. 
its poorly made with attention to detail. i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon. but they will not screw down all the way and are losse. it is useless!!! other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine. 
just assembly for a try, only few rolls with music, it's had some hole on head, that's mean bad quality. buyer beware for this kind of. 
not so pleased with the sound quality..sorta disappointed with it over all...but ya get what ya pay for ....so i'll keep it anyway 
crap these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bunless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of ernies i didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again 
i've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. mainly due to the low cost. they work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. the guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go \"flat\" sounding. these are not quality strings at all, just cheap chinese made quality. they are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. better strings are worth the extra cost. you actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. i've had this problem with all the d'addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. the tarnish and corrosion often up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster. 
i have played on d'addario before, actually the first string i started out on.super light's are ok, but can wear out real fast, so, it's importent not to put to much stess on them.....espescially if you do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme b, etc they will break. any skilled guitarist know's to use extream caution when tuning....any strings,i did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them) i would not recamhese for beginer's, cause beginer's to press hard, when they first stat out.personally, i don't like d'addario's at all, i find the tone to bright. 
far too slippery for my fingers when i shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well. 
this piece of plastic is just terrible. you'd be better off with a couple of books and a towel.not recomm! 
go build your own. build it to your specs and have a solid stand. if not, you can find a lot better head stands. this one was a huge disappointment. does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick. im back with my wood block and am happy. 
i might have done something wrong...i read in a review that these hold six picks.it held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart...i'll just keep using my pockets. 
man, this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks! do not BUY - it is a wast of money... ug! 
i use clayton 1.26mm picks, a heavy pick but certainly not oversized. my picks don't fit!!! if i shove them in, i can't get them out. also, this thing is huge for the back of the neck. 
my picks fall out way too easy while i'm playing live 
dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the near the plugs detirorate quickly. will never buy again even if only 5 bucks 
second one i bought. lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months. went through two of these before i learned my lesson. don't waste your money on this junk. i love planet waves stuff normally, but these are junk. 
i got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is no CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world....after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead,,, 
this was bought based on the advice of others. i had a cable with the standard neutrik/switchcraft-type fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.it worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. it happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that i swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. after confirming the guitar was okay, i tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.d'addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. you also have to get r.a. taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. the extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. in my case, i bit the bullet and did what i should have done the first go-round and got a really nice dimarzio cable.again, this cable sounds good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. the good news is that imo high price is not a guarantee of any cable sounding good. the replacement dimarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. i don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but i want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. this one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.so the replacement that planet waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. i figure i'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. if i have a few $ for the shipping and d'addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, i may get it replaced. more likely i will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - imo it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.if this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, i'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. and if d'addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. idk how much r&d; it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what i would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. that would not make it a deal breaker. 
well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks. bought a new f mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago. last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. messed around a bit and it started to work. today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp. thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy. got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either. at least my new amp is working and i only have to replace a $12 cord.maybe i'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if i bought it at a local store i'd return it. not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund. will just move on to another company's cord. 
the cable died on me in less than a month. very disappointed in built quality. 
these look so neat that my brother and i both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last christmas. unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play. 
i purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. i was disapointed when i mounted a shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. they may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. it would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. i wasted my money. don't waste yours. perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-) 
nice looking gooseneck, threads are clean, fits well. however, the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic (shure sm58) without collapsing. better try another brand, or sp buck or two more to get a better product. 
this arrived and when i tried to use it, it turned out that the male threads were some oddball metric size that does not fit any standard adapter.instead, these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip, so now i have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck and a clip.this is such a standard item, that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads, and no excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths... 
i have several mxr pedals. every one is superb--except for this phase 90 (the non- review ed here). this phase 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. i did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (look up \"mxr phase 90 mods,\" and \"erik's corner\" will show you how.) i made the \"r28,\" \"c11,\" and \"c12\" modifications. the result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. finally, i tried adjusting the internal trim pot. on no setting could i get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. i spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. no luck. bottom line: if you want a phaser that doesn't add significant distortion, avoid this incarnation of the phase 90. 
okay, color coding is a great idea.divas will not use the red ball windscreen.why?because, from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose.no kidding! i have had several tell this to me and my sound tech. so save your dough, buy any color but red.diva's!!!! what can i say? 
i bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a gls mic and it doesn't fit either. a little too small. 
yes you can tweak it so its less, but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable. 
do not use these to polish your guitar. it leaves tons of small fibers all over, and is hard to clean up. a total disaster. these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop, but not cleaning anything. 
not very substantial. it began to tear on my guitar strings. i was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses. 
this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy! you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit.i'm not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either- there are a lot of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable.over all i would not recommhis product. 
compression/sustain wise, this unit is decent but i cannot abide the noise ... i tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor ... 
if you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a guitar > volume pedal > amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a poorly engineered pedal. it can't be review .)it does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (not \"true bypass\" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal. i will need to try that out, but it does not excuse ernie ball from their responsibility. major fail on their part.2 stars is generous because eb fails to honor the simple \"first do no harm\" principle. it harms your tone. how dumb is that? the pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though i have my doubts about their \"string\" mechanism over time. the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.i have no recommions for a volume pedal. because of the feel, and esthetics, i do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver. 
if you are looking for a 100% leather mandolin strap, consider another strap. the outside surface of the planet waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man-made material glued to the thin leather part. i will be ordering the levys \"leather mandolin strap (walnut)\". 
i started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked, but when i tried to add a second/third stomp box, i couldn't get any guitar sound only a loud buzz. i returned this product i did further testing, i would not recommt to anyone. with my personal experience in mind, i would advise you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply. hope this helps 
i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar. my first cheap cord wasn't actually broken, but i didn't want any down time, so i had this just sitting there as a replacement. fast forward some time, and i just wanted to try it out. even though my cheap cord was still working fine, i really wanted to just try out the new cord.i really wish i had done that in the first 30 days. this cord did not work right at all. it seems like there is a short in it somewhere. i had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. of course since it is for guitar, it falls almost immediately out of place again. so, i am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed, unlike this brand new bad cable. 
through my ampeg bass amp, the low E string gets distorted when you push the bass control above 7, and the upper 3 strings sound kind of plain. 
my guitar originally came with d'addrio exp and they sounded good. i replaced them with elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. this time i got a 3 pack of ej16-3d light. the were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.but the sound is the problem. it's terrible. they sound very muddy. crisp tone distinction is just not there. i thought light would be the better route, but now i'm not sure. i purchased some others to try. also, since a purchased a 3 pack. i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings. 
bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand. mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges. the strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks i didn't like. tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes. g-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\\ 
the small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball hile tuning. i haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball uckily i bought the three pack.but i can't recommhis product. 
d'addario,what's up? these didn't last long at all.i don't play my martin very often,(too busy with electrics..) but these were trashed in a month.guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now? never purchase again. 
this is a beautiful shock mount. however for the price it didnt perform. the mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on p's and s's. not worth the price. 
i was not happy with the sound of these strings. the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny. for an extra $2 i bought the d'addario ej45 pro arte and got a much, much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old yamaha g-60. sphe extra $2 its well worth it. 
i tried the dean markley blue steel light accoustic strings on my takamine guitar, and will soon replace them. on quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar. string did not break as i rather expected, but it looks bad. on sound, these seemed okay at first, but i still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and e steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me. and i find the low E wound string notes to be too high as i move up the neck, more so than other sets i have used.guess i'll go back to d'addario and ernie ball. 
if you expect to get what you pay for, prepare to be disappointed. sounds weak. sounds old. sounds worn. sounds dull. i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster. i can afford to pay twice as much. but i am going to keep using my d'adario strings from now on. i am so disappointed. these strings are for the &#34;campfire guitarist&#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling, tapping, pull offs, or sweepers. if you are a tone fanatic keep looking. if your guitar deserves the best, do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. respect your guitar. i wouldn't be surprised if they are made from china. 
i thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings, they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret. 
i bought one of these in the beginning - just to have something - as this is better than having nothing at all - but it's certainly nothing special. the material and the skinny width was uncomfortable for me and exacerbated my neck pain, so i only used it for a very short time.on the other hand, if you have a nice guitar that you really take great care of, then you'll probably want to invest in a much nicer strap at some point. i upgraded to a really nice 3&#34; wide black leather levy's guitar strap - which is five stars all the way.if you're a newbie and don't have a strap, and are on a tight budget and need something, then this planet waves strap will probably work for you - till you can upgrade to something nicer and more comfortable to wear. just my 2 cents. 
i have a taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar. rather than ruin the finish of the guitar i just got a different strap. plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since i had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where i liked it to play. if the nylon is not a problem for you and the fit over your guitar this strap is very well made. 
s, i feel i got a different product, as it didn't fit the descriptions given by others. i ordered two of these, and both were very thin material, not sturdy at all. second, both straps were not adjustable to 59&#34;. both mine measured 45&#34; from strap button hole to strap button hole, fully-ext. they are useless to me, as my guitar, a dreadnought, covers the middle of my chest when i put it on. i believe i was given a substitute product, since when i ordered these straps, the price was just $1 0, and now they're back up to $4.95 as i write this. i'm really sick of these amazon substitutions. for what i paid, i won't bother returning them...not worth the hassle. i will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars. very disappointed. warning...if you see a price drop below $4.95, don't buy...it's probably not the product that's described here. 
good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice.this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought. i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by. over the 6 months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic i recently got and it keeps popping off. this is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house. the guitar could take that head dive of death, while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse.my advice: unless you plan to sit and play (which you wont really need a strap anyways) the whole time, splittle more to get a leather strap. spg more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play. 
i really wanted this to work, but it doesn't. don't bother,it doesn't mute the strings at all. one star, just for it getting here on time. 
i bought a glaesel bridge & this glaesel rubber mute together. i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews. the mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works very well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing. there is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on. also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.if you want or need a mute for practicing quietly (as many of us do), i suggest you buy something else. this item does not work and is a total waste of money. i tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new electric violin bought here on amazon (fyi, that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item! just make sure you buythe original peg drops by ardsley& aglaesel self-adjusting 4/4 violin bridge mediumwith it!).i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all. it does not mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way. 
pedal is not working, it just making noise. poor quality control.actually it looks like used pedal, not like new.don't recommhis product. 
all i gotta say about this product is that i get a volume/tone loss when it's plugged; that is a very big problem for me. other than that is very well built, but the fact that it decreases my volume is a major issue for me. 
the travel would be tolerable for a sitting position..., but i stand in front of a mic on stage. the pedal generates a lot of &#34;noise&#34; so i can't use it. you get what you pay for. king vox and dunlop high Gain, both passive, have passed the test, and i'm pretty picky! 
i purchased this as an extra cv controller for a digitech control 2. when i got it, i tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and yes it does suck the tone right out of the signal. as far as a cv controler? it sucks at that too! why? it squeaks as you move it (after 5 minutes use, right out of the box). behringer is a joke and gives german engineering a bad name (although only 'conceived' in germany).it's a direct copy of the yamaha fc9 and so i am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares. i'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it.also, you may say \"who cares if it squeaks a little\"? well i do when i am controlling volume swells or a 'wah' effect at low volume in the studio!good luck if you buy it. 
first.the photo shows no ON/OFF switch, however this does not catch any attention.and all seller seems to have trouble to say \"this product does not have this, does not have that...\" it only says what the product does have.oh well, i got stuck with two microphones without on/off switch.i can buy an adapter with on/off switch for microphone. 
pretty disappointed in the color. as the review title indicates, what i received is more of a 'black chrome' or dingy stainless color. these are simply not going to work with the mots pickguard i purchased them for. perhaps they would bln better on a black, black pearl or tort pickguard.i ordered another package from another v and got the same result. perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is 'bad'. some are very dull looking. very disappointing, really. 
i can't believe these were actually sent to me. the heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened. they come from taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to china. i am sg them back. there is no way i would use these. any screw you get from home depot would work better and look more attractive. i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from f and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost. 
i was a little disappointed. don't know if it's a qc problem or if i just got some rejects but out of 6 pots, 1 was out of spec (315k) and 2 were almost out (289k, 205k). 1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10%. they are ctl's so i'm a bit confused. other than that they work fine, they have the nut, washer and cap included (no knob). i will be upgrading the caps. 
this pickguard was used. it not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before. 
i would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a squier bullet strat, but the holes didn't line up, it didn't fit between the neck and the bridge, in fact, it was completely wrong. nice quality though. 
bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat. doesn't fit perfect. kinda bummed but oh well 
buttons itself are fine, however when i was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar (right above the thread). and i even pre-drill it. there is no way i can get it out :( so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it (now slightly off-center now) 
need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) i have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently i needed and ordered some and i found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). guess these are too cheap for f to have qc on.will try other brands next time. 
i've ordered two of these kits in the aged white, and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate. literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor, accidentally stepped on them, and then decided they were good enough to sut for sale. the knobs, covers and tips are all in great shape, however. 
unless you guys are receiving something i am not, how can you give this anything more than one star. my backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my f stratocaster. this is inexcusable. all the other f backplates i have have enough lip to cover the route, but not this mint green one. i simply cannot understand what f is thinking. i am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from f and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost. 
my first desk mic stand, and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use. it worked once when i originally set it, then kaput. it's never worked properly since. i still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it's at the right height. i would not purchase this product again. 
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings. these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string to break before they even get tuned to pitch, ernie ball strings are garbage, the only time i will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are sed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh, you can sp$ for a set of ernie ball or d'addario every 2 days or you can sp7 for a set of dr strings and change them once a month, or you can sp0$ for a set of elixir polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months, it doesn't make sense to use these crappy ernie's unless you are sponsored by eb and have an ss supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars, 
it is ok, but it does not compare to the ergo holder.which you may find here:dunlop ergo pickholder.the main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out, and it is extremely fragile. 
i bought one of each soft, medium and hard wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the hard is as soft as the soft. they felt exactly the same in fact. the medium was the hardest out of the bunch.packaging error? i have no idea. the fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. so check with what you get.sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.there is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that i do not think it is idea for strumming.the only reason i can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead. 
s i read stated that these were like rigid picks, but no they are not. too bad as i had high hopes.Good picks if you don't have to tremolo pick, not very good if do have to. 
s carefully - it's definitely something different, but not sturdy at all, rubber bits come off as you strum, and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers. ouch! i'm much happier with my friday the 13th glow-in-the-dark picks - that is an experiment that worked!and who cares about hard pick sounds anyway? if you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming, why don't you use&#8230; your fingers? 
these picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar. i don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. big disappointment. i'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. back to the drawing board i go. 
on the music stand. that comes with a solid extension arm... 
ok, it was cheap (nine bucks at the time), the design looked good and sensible, and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need. i bought it without hesitation. however(!), once hooked up, i was very surprised how flimsy it is. i have a 13\" gooseneck, a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it. at the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand. obviously, any small bump into the stand will once again set this off. using it at home, i've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful, but obviously this unit is far from ideal. since then, i've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand, and though i haven't really put through its paces yet, this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable, and only costs a few bucks more (on stage msa9508 posi-lok sidemount boom). for anyone considering this product, i highly recommypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the on stage msa9508 posi-lok sidemount boom. you will be far far happier.cheers! 
i thought i could take the smell. i couldn't.otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding.the case is nice too, but everything smells like the chinese rubber smell at harbor freight tools. (sulfur?)i tried airing it out for a week with no success.If you have no sense of smell, get one. 
the material it's made of is good, and it holds the guitar. the only things i don't like are 2.1)each of the corners has a cap. the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off.2)the part at the bottom that looks like a u (used to hold the guitar) it spins... it means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still, so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight.i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one. 
it's semi-secure on carpeting or hard floor, but all together i am pretty unsatisfied with this stand. the bottom piece has no way to lock in place, and although with the guitar on it it is more stable, i am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy...i prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall. this one? meh. not worth the purchase in my opinion... booooooooo. 
er who has, upon personal inspection, discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar. i returned it.i've &#34;first act&#34; brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed. 
this arrived with one f the security strap and metal part...broken! ok...i bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option...it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it!obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box.of course,i could not recommhis product to anyone...most disappointing purchase! 
purchased these for a new heritage h-575 arch top. a few months later, the high E string unwound from the ball overall good strings, good sound -- this set simply didn't last very long. i will replace with 12s however. for me the 11s felt a little loose. the 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box. i have 12s on an epiphone joe pass model. i'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s. 
the version i picked came with a grounding wire, claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic-producing snap, crackles, and pops. if you believe that, continue to do so, and maybe you'll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device. speaking more pragmatically, i've found some use for the item only when loose, conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc. 
i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop 7000 locks. i recommhe 7000 model. they both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way, but these are just to big and clumsy. the 7000 model does the same and doesn't take as much space. you will need the straps to either be thin at the or your strap buttons/pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units. this is true for either one of the models. i have a regular nylon 2&#34; levy strap and these two models (7000 and 7007si) work well, but i prefer the smaller, rounder model (7000). 
they only fit if you have enough room in your strap button, if not they will just pop right out. i threw mine away. 
i even called dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic. the guy at dunlop told me \"oh yes, they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic\". that is not the case. i purchased multiple units, and it will cost me more to return to amazon than it's worth. but basically i know have hunks of plastic that i could use to make a sculpture!because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up, the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap, please reply to this feedback.what really frosts me is that i called dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don't know their products well enough to be recommg product. it's called, train your people!!! 
hard to believe this was so bad. i have a planet waves locking guitar strap, which is a dream, and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap. however, it is so thick that it can't really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap, and when i tried to lock it, the two pieces came apart. go with the planet waves lock straps. 
i bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what i found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something). the release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.bottom line: if you don't mind the extra effort and don't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using, then maybe you will enjoy it. for everyone else, look elsewhere. 
barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer's defects ... the unit does what it was meant to do. i do however question whether the word \"pro\" should apply to this system. although the 1/4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer, the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system. the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about. to its defense, it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away.after playing with the device for a couple more minutes, i noticed that any movement whether i kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and i moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception. even the length of the mic cord, whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sg unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality. yikes!!! perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which i previously described above. i'm afraid this would not be a very usable and deple device for my purposes. i'll probably be returning this unit asap. 
i bought this because--hey, a wireless mic for $13? why not? i might be able to use this in a public address system--the connections all work, and it makes sounds, but the static is unbearable no matter how much i fiddle with different, the adjustment screw in the receiver... nothing works. the audio is always clipped. don't even think of using this for music. 
arrive, in trashed packing, but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard... certainly not professional quality or any quality that i would give it. 
i got these for a custom les paul 5 string bass i had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses. also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use. i had never used strap locks before and don't think i will again. 
our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago. every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p-bass...not good. my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekhe problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself. we've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.we tried to make the shallers work but just could not. maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us. 
no where on the description does it say that the mic clip is not included. the only place is on the box after you have received the item. there's no instruction (which is fine). but in the product description it doesn't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can't use it.i bought this and have it shipped second day because i need to use it and now i can't because it doesn't come with a mic clip which i have to spnother 5-10 to get it plus shipping. the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip. but without it, i felt cheated. 
the only reason i'm not giving this one star is that i didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. i got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. we have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. nope. this pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way. avoid. 
i purchased this as my first guitar slide. i loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. i almost cut myself! i will never buy a glass slide again, i recently bought a dunlop brass slide and love it. the difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. i would not suggest this to anyone. the metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. there's a reason all pros use metal! the review below is wrong. slides are meant to cover your entire finger, all the way to the tip. you don't bour finger to play slide. you retune your guitar to an open tuning. just thought i would point that out. 
cheap crappy strap. it's too stiff, not comfortable at all. i regret purchasing this... save your money, go hunt for a coach strap or something similar. they are expensive but worth it. 
this is my first guitar belt, it is not a good fit, the connection to the guitar is far too thick, i try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage. other than that it is usable, sort of, but i am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead, the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with. 
i've two of these stands. on one of them, the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld. if you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand, you'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there. mine lost its weld, so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - i was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor!update: 1/9/12 glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand. beware! ...and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in..............wait for it................china. that may explain why it failed, but glen ingles could have offered to replace it. i guess he doesn't want me to buy any more of his products, or refer others to his products. well, that's his policy. that's okay, he's got competition, and i'll be purchasing from them instead. 
my problem is that i am used to playing hohner golden melody and special 20 harps. i guess i should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings. these harps have no volume. don't waste your money on them. i guess the only thing worth having is the case, but the case has no handles or carry strap.5/25/14 - i said the case had no handle, well i take that back. there is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat. i was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it. with one finger i can carry the case with my quality harps inside. 
disappointing; was looking for to receiving these.but; mostly they are unplayable. leak air badly. easier learning bagpipes than these things.save your money and get some harps that actually work.decent case though. 
i have other harmonica's but thought i'd like a set of blues harps. i thought that if it's made by hohner, it must be fairly good. wow, was i wrong. too hard to push notes through them. i wouldn't recommhese to anyone. 
crikey, where to begin. firstly, i hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet. secondly, they mismarked one of the packets, so it appeared i had two &#34;d&#34; strings, instead of two &#34;e&#34; strings. lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! they were tinny and clangy sounding. i've never heard worse strings. fortunately, i had bought a package of ernie ball earthwood med. light, as well. i replaced the godawful martins with the ernie ball's and they were far, far better! shame on martin for such a piss poor product. i'll never buy their strings again. 
i am very disappointed. the guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body.it is unusable until repaired.update: it has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller (amazon), and have not received any communication. 
dampit was recomm to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and i have used the standard model for some time. it seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.i used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while i was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.later i wound up trying the humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a dreadnought, i took to putting the dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a planet waves microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the f the cloth to soak it. then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the f the polishing cloth to cover the wet ith dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. worked great.so i ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. they now ship without the clips. company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though i didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. more importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when i pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. so i sent it back to amazon for a refund. no problem getting the refund, but i'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.if you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the om model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else. 
i wanted to like this. i really did. the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;perfect&#34;. however, the unit i received was cr@p, and i'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. the one i got kept cutting in and out. you might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. and when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. frustrating.i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. the so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. bummer. any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?cheers 
the only instrument this works well on is my yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings i want more pressure, i advise getting the ns capo that is not \"lite\ i prefer that one above this model. 
i ordered one of these because i like my other planet waves capo a lot (i believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;lite&#34;). however, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a martin jumbo acoustic). it will barely bhe strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.i'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. it doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as i can tell. unless i just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, i wouldn't recommt for any guitar without a thick neck.my recommion is the classic kyser capo thats more deple and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). if you are looking for the screw-down style, i would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;lite&#34;. 
it is inexpensive but is difficult to use anywhere with other noise..i used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning, although probably would not be used by most musicians.. other than that i think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. i would not recommt. 
it doesn't seem to work. i think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water. 
the sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long. also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.i'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it. 
the chorus is subtle... but it seems lacking to me. it is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have. 
this thing is useless. good idea, but way too light/rickety to be useful. unless you're constantly aware of it, 99% of the time you'll p just kicking it over when you go to put your foot on it. pass on this. 
i've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so i guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore useless. thanks to this problem i am only able to use two slots out of twelve. it's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this. 
it's really not a 200w system. the booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and i doubt it is really even that powerful. the wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it. my shure xlr wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug. the instrument input works ok with my taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud. i guess it's ok as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals. 
this system works just okay. try to turn it up and you get bad feedback.my microphone stopped working shortly after i purchased this item. i contacted pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them.they couldn't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one, or where i could even buy a replacement.very frustrating! 
i have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, i have had enough.the main problem with this tuner is the usability.the tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.the needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever i pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.the poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.enough said, i bought a new tuner, the seiko sat800, for a bit more money that this.the main differences between sat800 and the ca-40:sat800 has a build-in light, ca-40 does not.ca-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, sat800 does not.sat800 has a auto and manual mode, ca-40 has auto.sat800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1e, 2e, etc, ca-40 displays only displays the alphabet, e for all oactaves.sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off, ca-40 does not.the needle graph on the seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.i wholly recommou do not purchase this tuner. i was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on amazon and i hope you would not be. 
this tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. as soon as i insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low b flat and stays there... even if the guitar and bass are not on the other at first i thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, i also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input. 
i've been very disappointed with this tuner. when i've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right(sharp) then back to the left(flat). i have two(2) other tuners i bought from wal-mart and i always get accurate tunings from them. i bought this korg because it's a brand name and the company has an outstanding reputation. even though my tow(2) wal-mart tuners are older, they both still work better than this korg. 
there are better tuners out there. far better. this could be good, but it seems to me that all korg products seem to think of standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to standard (especially when tuning the g string)! i personally play exclusively in standard for my electric playing, but sometimes i want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. this piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using \"f\" or \"c\" notes. i have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (i say that with love) that play in open tunings. trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere. 
this would have been a nice slide if i could get it on my finger. i'm borderline skinny and it still won't fit. save your money unless your under 10 years old. 
lets face it, in general string winders are pretty much all the same right? wrong! i went with this one because i trusted the dunlop name. what a let down. on the second guitar i used it on the handle and the head separated, sure you can press it back together, but after separating several times on every string, it gets a little old....quick. already ordered a different one to replace it. one thing i cant stand is inferior tools. 
ok its cheap. you knew that when you bought it. i really thought it was going to be more then one since it said assorted and showed a few in the picture. it was only one and it was red. broke with first use. 
in the old days, we used tobe able to buyall 6 nylon clear strings....now tis almost impossible....with these strings on even a cheap or semi decentclassic geeetar....one will prefer playing on the hi 3 treble strings...very nice, resonant, and clean...not shrillbutwhat is that garbage metallica with the other 3 supposed to bebass strings i dont know...again, like someone else noted the obvious>>>>>sound transition from the nylon to the wire wound nylon is gigantic.this makes the move from the d to the g string too noticablecant they even make 6 strings that sound similar for the same one guitar even ?makes it sound like 2 different geeetars totally...sucks bad now.oohthanks man 
this strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good, also doesn't fit an instrument where there's no place to hook it . i returned mine, as it just didn't fit well for my uke or mandolin. 
sorry f...this one is just a waste of money. get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots. 
don't know what i expected for such a cheap price, but this product's quality is in line with its price. also, the fit over my ukulele's fretboard is very tight, making it hard to put on and remove. 
this one is probably closer to a $150 guitar. the fit and finish is quite nice but at the f the day it's just like most of the other made in china guitar. from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200, but i'm not at all impressed. one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they're a jack of all trades but a master of none.i recently bought a johnson jg-610-n, a johnson jg-620-n, a bristol bd-16, a jasmine s35, and this yamaha. if i'd only played the yamaha i'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side i can definitely say it's not at all amazing. the bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better. the johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish. the jasmine is nice but i haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.the yamaha fg700gs is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low unch. now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great. the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison. also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit \"hive mind\" where everybody buys into a hype. maybe i got a dud guitar, but i doubt it, they're all made in the same factory. 
i bought this to connect a technics tt with an audio technica cartridge to my newer onkyo receiver with no phono input. the unit did work but i had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume. in addition i have an onkyo m3040 connected to the receiver that i use for as a zone 2 amplifier. with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp. they are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop. i do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.this unit may work perfectly fine with a behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all. i am returning it. 
the mixer is good for the price but i had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside. the packing way below average. as a matter of fact, it was the only outer box without any cushioning. after seeing those ups and fedex delivery videos i would not pack a ups or fedex shipping item in such a poor packing. however, the great seller ( i am referring to amazon) immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit. second unit too had the similar packing but no damages. worked fine. 
considering the price is so cheap on these, i took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. to say that i used it \"rarely\" is an understatement - maybe once a month when i have friover for jamming as a way to get my vdrums and a bass di through my powered wedges. that said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume all the way up.aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. however, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero. 
this pedal, in short, sucks. there's no point to having an a/b pedal if it adds a huge amount of hiss to your sound. behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this. 
i'd give this 1 and a half stars if i could. this little amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it. it is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this. i can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output, and hardly anything in the other. i have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second. i can still use this, but hardly. i really don't like this. 
it's a decent unit, but stopped working completely after about 6 months. tried everything i could, but it's gone. i would not recommhis pedal. 
behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light, cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging. i just didn't want to sp100 on the boss version, but you get what you pay for! another thing that i hate is it's really hard to change the battery, unlike the boss pedals. save your money and steer clear of this one. i also bought a behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out. 
if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. pay the extra money and get something quiet. others complained about this and they were right. if you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. some complained about each band boosting others. this is more of a user problem than manufacturing. if you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. in this respect, its like an mxr 6 band. 
bought this because of all the great reviews, butthis doesn't work, just like the last beringer product i bought. will i ever learn? very disappointing.UPDATE- now working; got my mate an aussie genius to have a look.found pedal wasn't engaging when pushed down.took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on; sheer genius.worked fine with cover off; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber. and it still works.amazing sound actuallystill not sold on berhinger though 
ok i understand it now - i use abelton live 8 and thought this would be and easy, read cheap, interface to record some instruments with. wrong! i am returning it. it does not work, has no drivers and is not detected on my mac (my mac finds everything). bought the focusrite unit instead. got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings. save your money and time. buy the focusrite interface or one of the others. yes over $100 but you either want feedback, hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance. it also lacks 1/4 plug, one rca input, you need an addapter. not what i thought i was getting - dumb me. 
not very bright. not very flexible. too big. clunky. i really don't like it. i wish i had went in a different direction. 
soi f you want to turn distor t off,u cannot.dig?it s always on...alwaysif you like hard rock that wayu need this tiny gig thingie 
while the product came as described, the build quality felt a little lacking. on the website it mentioned that it accepts the shure ksm32 threading but it does not, so if you're threading matches the ksm32, look elsewhere. 
i picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store. who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right? the price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well. the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate. it gets you in the ballpark, but just barely. strike a note once, and it's sharp. play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune. i think the korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better. 
strings rust very easily, yield fairly poor tone and break often, though they have the same bg ability as 9-.42. 
pros:-price point-good, clean audio quality when working.-changeable mesh ballscons:-limited upper frequency response (&#62;8khz)-one stopped working after about half an hour of use. it was not dropped or abused in any way.-requires nearly direct line of sight between transmitter and receiver for any distance greater than 10 feet. 
they say 2-4 months, i've never come close to even a month. usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks. if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. i don't recommhese. 
i bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage. i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d-28, but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.imagine my profound disappointment.really, boss??? this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours. this thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the review s on-line. seems like it is part of the design. it's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. totally unusable, as far as i'm concerned. by the way, i tested it direct to a pa as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat). 
summaryacoustic sounds &#34;ok&#34;, but noisy in weird ways. i returned it. price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.pros- boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable- standard 9v power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs.- variety of acoustic sounds possible. (personally, i only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- while i have several boss pedals, i think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small. i prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.details:the basic concept is good. i had an ac-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. it wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. it was also just noisy in the pedal chain. adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. however, i sold that model because i didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and i wasn't happy with the sound. at the time, the ac-2's were selling for about $85 new. boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac-3.i bought the ac-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the ac-2 -- and they did, a little. but not enough to keep it. i returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. i think the ac-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead. they make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;. the 400 has reverb on the pedal. i opted for the 300 and got it for $25. i expect the durability will be lower on the behringer than the boss as it has a plastic case. however, this is an effect i pull out just once in a while and since i can buy 4 or 5 or 6 behringers for the price of a boss....if it breaks...i'll just buy another.i also have a boss gt-100 multi-effects unit. you can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the behringer or out of the boss ac-3. the least cost effective of those choices is the ac-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.i'm not saying its a bad pedal, i'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. if they would fix the noise issues, i might have even kept it. i did opt to keep the behringer for those times i'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. this boss pedal just didn't work that well for me. 
i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac-33 acoustic amp. the pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy. however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate. this is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch. the worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out. the only way i could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made. for the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that boss would put out a better product. i also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question. i would highly recommhat you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site. 
when i purchased this i'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar. guess what? as far as i can tell, there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with. this is not worth the money. 
disapointed. the sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound. it sound muffled. i will have to replace it soon. 
..it works.but expect some flaws.first,finding a driver to use was a pain.it doesn't come with a software disc,so look on behringer's support site for driver download.whatever driver you do use it kills all other audio,you can't run any other media player and get sound.my advice is unless you have a dedicated pc or laptop for using this...get something else. 
in fact, i don't think this hosa gtr215r cord lasted 2 hours. one step on the cord and it came apart. this purchase is the very reason why i'm looking to buy a wireless system. maybe if you're using this to run a pa i would recommt. but if any performer is hard on their cords i wouldn't recommhis item....but to be fair, i would recommireless to any performer. you'll p saving money over the long haul. 
the mic itself nor the cable that comes with the mic as they were both non-responsive. i tried the mic with other cables i have lying around that i know work, and i got nothing; it was like the mic wasn't plugged in at all. and the cable included in this pack, well, the plastic (not metal) connector to the mic was cracked. i still tried it with a difference mic... static.i can't blame amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.the stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package. i was impressed at how much of is isn't plastic.Still... i can't recommhis product. 
the good:this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.the bad:the tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination, unless you like hyper-distorted noise. the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied. the effects are hit and miss as well. plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive.throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, i'd be hard-pressed to recommhis product unless you really need to practice through headphones. 
it's a good ideal but the big problem i have is if ya are using a tube amp. ( have a 65' twin reverb f tube ) ya get one hell of a hum. it's so bad i just can't use it at all. i'm not sure about a transistor amp. but who uses those ???? 
doa...no good, out of the box,plug it, nothing.....no way to st back (i`m not from the states)....meaning...i just wasted away $40 something bucks (add shipping)....i did bought a behringer pedal before (tremolo/pan) with good results, but i guess there`s two sides to this particular low economy pedals....well, i`ll man up and buy something else... 
i heard great things about the s6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, i bought it based upon reviews. i've played it for a year, and after spg many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:- the seagull is comparatively unattractive. its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- the cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- the laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;/resonant during playing.- the satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- the cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom eems muddy.- the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok.- the binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something i've not encountered before.- i can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!all in all, it is an ok instrument that stands out simply because it's made in canada for asian/mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. in fact, for the price range, i can get a just-as-good asian/mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.i don't regret getting it, but i feel like i overpaid for what i received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, i have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. seagull to me is over-hyped.thanks for reading! 
it sounds very artificial, i remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had, now that i use it with a better amp, it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it's not even worth the price i payed for it before. i also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didn't want to lock with my guitar cable and when i took it apart, there was no way for me to fix it other than sg it to be replaced. shitty pedal. 
ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home \"12/23/11\" and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset, i would not returned because i don't feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for. 
in my experience these cables were not great. the connectors rattle, they are made of cheap materials and the cable subsequently had a ton of line noise. i can't expect miracles at that price-point but i certainly expected better. i avoid this brand of cables. 
i bought this unit for a friand i could compare with others overdrives i already have. i think the mxr badass custom modified overdrive or way huge green rhino are better choise. 
i am a tone freak. i bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff. at the time i had never owned a big muff. i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound. i later took it to my frihouse and matched settings with a real big muff. the difference was huge. the big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box. i later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging. i am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal. i would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space 
it was not what i wanted. when a person has a low Income we can not afford what we can not use. i was looking for what is called shimmer most reverbs do not have shimmer as the rv600 because digitech called shimmer, string swell and volume swell is linked to the violin sound it cost me 30 0 its called slow motion for a reason because it has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear it is with over drive being played on the high Strings. it might be good for playing with a bow, i have no Idea because i can not afford a bow. 
i just got this and i've noticed that it when i activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom ut of my tone... i have a crybaby that doesn't have the range the 847 does but its 10x's more transparent. there may be other factors at play here as it is new, but the lesson is: try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you. 
my hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder. the gel is pretty dense, so it's kind of hard and squishy and very heavy! i found that it just added more weight. i'm not using it. i would look elswhere for a different product. 
to heavy....it doesn't stay where you need it. slips down becuase of wieght.. get something else or larger strap to dispers wieght of the guitar... 
these cans were decent, back when they were just above 100 bucks. they've inflated to 160 and that's just ridiculous. there is better in this price range. the srh840's for example on ebay for 120~ bucks new, does everything better than these cans. the m50's have really punchy bass, and extremely stringent highs, they're very loose in the low and their mids are recessed. that combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience. the pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable, whilst having an almost starchy texture to them. the headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath. these phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all, which means for gaming, these will be pretty terrible. they do some... some... new genres alright, but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to. they also can't do lighter genres like jazz and classical due to their poor positoning. there are much much better monitors in this price range than these, the shure srh840 as i've said before totally outclass these headphones in all areas.stay away, don't fall victim to the noob hype. 
garbage if you like it...then buy it.this is not how the world of music sounds.too much bass and other garbage...are you guys really HEARING anything ?world has gone bass crazy since about 1981...more and more..we lost analog, we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp3, and now to put morecrap into our ears, they give you onefrequency...bass only , take it or leave it.will go find real headphones, thanks.kb 
if you want to use this to power up a tascam dr series digital recorder, i have a less expensive solution for you: if you own a usb wall charger (like a cell phone charger), you can use that to power your device through its usb port. that's a lot cheaper than spg twenty-something dollars on an additional wall wart! 
i purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price. after trying to use it i promptly returned it. i do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows. i have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer. i tried recording on the h2 using it's line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my mackie sound board or my stereo receiver. no matter how i set the levels the recording on the h2 was very distorted. i played with the record levels and the agc and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal. i have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean, good quality sound. the problem with my h2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal, which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp. recording from the internal mics seems to work fine. i have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the zoom recorders are the only brand where i have found this problem.the h2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings, look for something else. i exchanged this model for an h4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal, but not as bad as the h2. i finally  up getting the tascam dr-07 which i am very happy with. it has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder. 
if you can read the tiny little screen, this thing records nicely. but it's a pain in the axx to move from one selection to the other. there were a couple of times i almost threw against the wall. it has a tcy to completely freeze up and the on/off switch does nothing. you have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again. 
the cables are great for the price cant go wrong i have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables.don't buy this cables they keep failing, cheap material with what i spent on them you could buy a couple decent ones 
i have finally learned my lesson.i have purchased a number of these over the last year or two.. and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say \"good for static applications\" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage, even along the length of the cable, not just at the connectors...but they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok.but now, after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer i checked it out and it seemed to work.a week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain.. yup..the cable.so by all means buy these on price, but when you get your items..please fully check them out.. a simple \"does it work yes/no\" is clearly not good enough, as i learned 
be careful; i have a small recording studio, so we put our cables through a lot, and these guys just don't last. they were fine for the first few months, but then they started to die like a murder mystery. seriously, one after another they would just go, for no apparent reason.fine one second, and then it would just go horribly staticky. i actually had two blow at one time, and thought my pa was shot. thankfully, it was just these cables. not GOOD. sp little extra on another brand. these have been my favorite:gls audio 25ft cable cords 
i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people. the strap is about 6\" too short for my seagull s6 guitar. i will say the build quality is great but too short, is and remains, too short. i will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extput into the strap. i just can't understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short.2/22/2013 i fired off an email to levy and the long and \"short\" of all this is you will have to fork over another $30 to buy an extfor this strap. i don't quite understand why they don't make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $30 to make it work right in the first place. here's a link to the extoptionlevy's leathers mmgxl-2.5-brn strap ext link removed the irony here is i managed to buy the last one for the immediate future.this is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider. i got the extstrap and it does not match the original so now i have this cobbled up looking guitar strap. it's sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other. i will keep this strap but sure feel like i've been had on this purchase... the terms bait and switch come to my mind. 
levy's leathers could have made this guitar strap out of a softer material, especially on the edges. it cuts into your neck horribly, even thru a shirt. yukko. the fake leather on the are unbelievably cheap. 
i have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem, but i got literally 8 plug-ins, and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain. it's like i got an extension cord and male outlets on both  soooo it's pretty much useless to me. i guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them, i guess you could plug this into it but i really see no point. i would've shipped it back i lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss. i think i payed like $8 for it so whatever. i would recommoing to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male and the female 
i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a &#34;1 spot&#34; brand plug. it is not what i received. instead i received a generic plug for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose, but a really cheap version. the plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic. the original 1 spot plug has much smaller plugs, great for saving space on a pedal board, and the wires are soft and &#34;rubbery&#34;, again making it easier to work with on a pedal board, specially if you're working with a pedal board like pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars. i informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would se the correct one. in my email to them i included an image of the original packaging of the 1 spot 8 plug to make sure there would be no mistake, but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug. i emailed them again for a refund, which they promptly did. i can say, that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money. i imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 spot plug, wouldn't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors. i strongly recommsphe extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 spot 8 plug. 
first behringer pedal i have returned. almost no effect provided by pedal. i have returned the unit. not worth it. lousy pedal. 
i give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do. i give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period. generously, i'll give it 2stars. something like this really should last at least a year or more. cheap parts/manufacturing? 50 cents a day is not a good deal for a device of this nature. 
sound is not so good. strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything. 
i used ac30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these.sound quality of ac30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrs clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.for people worried about construction, these turned out to be very sturdy (ac30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same).even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy ac30, the latter has acceptable cleans.. 
as an amateur musician, i'm always looking for ways to practice without chasing everyone out of the house with loud amplifiers and such. i thought this gadget would do the trick, but the quality of the sound and range of adjustment just didn't meet my expectations. 
bought this years ago. it was a nice long cable that i bought figuring it'd be durable but it didn't last. maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig... if i was better with wiring i'm sure it's fixable but all in all it didn't last as long as i'd hoped. 
cable crackles when plug in jack is moved. gls brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison. both have tweed jackets however the hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the gls cable does. i would recommhe gls product over the hosa product. 
the cable hisses, crackles and pops right out of the package. save your money and buy a better cable. i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective. i would definitely not buy this product again or recommt to anyone else. 
the vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone. it now rest at bottom of a box. 
as i've heard with the pyle pro amps, i received mine today, and it was defective. only one channel worked, and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep. the packaging was very good though, so i'm thinking this looks like a refurb/used, and they listed it as new. already printed the return shipping label, and it will head back to the amazon warehouse on monday... 
this cover does not fit a full size acoustic/electric hohner guitar. i measured the whole at 3 7/8&#34;, but this cover does not even come close to fitting! it measures 4 1/6&#34; in diameter, so check your guitar closely! 
doesn't reduce sound worth a darn. i thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things. muddies it up a bit maybe, but not really a reduction in db. 
these speakers worked great for 14 months. last week (4/8/13), one of them wouldn't power up all the way. the problem is getting worse every time i try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working. it seems there is a problem with the capacitors that i did read about in a few reviews. i took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. i only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. i contacted m-audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. one on the east coast and one on be west coast. i've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the internet and on the m-audio support site. m-audio doesn't stand behind their products, and i'll never purchase anything from them again. 
on the plus side, these monitors look and feel amazing. they are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.they don't sound horrible. i mean, they are not computer speakers or anything. the sound is very forward, i would say harsh. that's not uncommon among studio monitors. there is definitely a lot of clarity here. not a ton of bass, but that's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size. there's a few schools of thought on studio monitors. some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music, others think they should sound more like a normal speaker. these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first. i definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this. any flaws would be quite noticeable.i previously used krk rp8's so i can compare these to them. granted, they are larger and more expensive, although they are also budget monitors. i liked them better than these. they were clear but also sounded nicer and, of course, had much more bass.i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in...see if i could improve the situation...but one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it's turned on. the buzz increases in volume over time. i tried moving them to a different location, turning the volume down, even disconnecting the audio feed (so they were only plugged into the power). nothing stopped the buzz. if they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds. so i sent them back. i wasn't really impressed with the sound and i'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so i'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead. maybe behringer 3031a's or something. i think it's worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full-sized monitor. 
sound nice, but very unreliable bx5a deluxe.i own a pair of yamaha ns 10s and event 20-20s, and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.2 years ago i purchased a set of regular bx5a's, and they lasted about 1 1/2 years, and then the faulty capacitors leaked.i just replaced them with the bx5a deluxe model, and after only one week. one of the internal amps will no longer power up.i need a pair of affordable av shielded monitors that i can depn, and these cheap m-audio monitors are not it.I am back to using my 20-20's with slight av noise until i find a decent av shielded monitor.m-audio was a much better company before avid took them over! 
in an attempt to see what's new in the pick industry, i decided to dive in and give these a go. they are way too flimsy if, like me, you use a heavier pick. i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just can't compete. not only were they too flimsy, but when i played with any aggression (heavy rock-based material), the picks would fly out of my hands. this was a huge disappointment. 
good grip, but too flexible, and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks. probably good for strumming, but not good for lead. 
this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal. i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature. but was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with.anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay. and on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem, hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise. also the pedal just started oscillating a few times. i would have given the behringer us600 five stars if it kept working, it tracked nice and didn't tone suck too bad. 
some things are great values, others are cheap. the behringer is cheap. the clips are cheap. the clip that holds the 9v broke after the first change. the clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic. if you get stuck using batteries, plan on 3-4 hours worth of use. it's also a noisy pedal. like noisier than my dyna comp and od pedals combined. like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise. if you leave it plugged into your cables, even when powered down, it will eat your batteries.all of those negatives aside, you are paying less than $40 for a reverb pedal that has several usable features. the 63' spring is great, the plate is also really good. it also has a worth-the-price-alone \"space\" feature. also known as shimmer (a synth playing behind your instrument). paired with a chorus effect, you can get some really cool tones.the rv600 is not without merit, but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features. if you gig or record and need a reverb...well...you aren't even looking at this pedal. if you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn't have a reverb built in, this is a good option. 
had i known what i was getting i would never have ordered it. there are gig bags and there are gig bags. i've ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags. i expected more. this one offers almost no protection. the only reason i have not returned it yet is that the return shipping will leave little to refund, but may p returning it anyway.it did fit my kala ka-tg with room to spare. 
unhappy with it, actually i already replaced them. the method of attachment is poorly designed, it doesn't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls, the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions. expensive locks too. 
i had some issues with my 18-watt all tube amp so i experimented and replaced all the tubes. issues not only continued but worsened. hum, noise, volume fade, unwanted distortion at low volumes. i eventually put back the original el84s and that didn't help. once i removed the tung-sol 12ax7 preamp tubes and replaced, the hum stopped, sound quality of the amp was consistent, quiet and back to par. my experience with the tung-sol tubes was very, very negative. they caused me to go out and buy another amp. i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast. i'll never buy this brand again. 
don't buy this chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand. it is barely workable for two.it is easy to set up, but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place. and you absolutely have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.the best thing these stands are built for are v type guitars such as my jackson rhoads as long as you can put them back to back. for les paul and strat type axes, their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow, stick like feet of the stand, especially when they are new. you can't tilt the feet up to try to lore stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible. so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand. if you just gotta buy something from on stage, get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it up being better balanced. but really, you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for. 
this seems to have been a rare case but still, i had my ukulele on is and it snapped, i'm worried what might happen with a guitar or a bass 
i purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when i placed my guitar in it. upon close inspection, the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube. the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe 25&#34; wall, so don't expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off- even if it is welded better than mine was. just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs- it is literally that thin of metal tubing.for $10-11 i did not expect perfection, so to it's credit- it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars.this stand does have one other good quality- it is cheap! since it was less that $11, i cannot see going through the hassle of returning it. i was able to carefully weld mine back together- but this would probably not be an option for most. the stand might work fine if you don't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up- but if you need portability and durability- i would definitely purchase a better quality stand. 
this is a fantastic product that is well made. the plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use. this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition.the tool is extremely useful. i have just started playing with a band, and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in. with the wheel, i immediately know what chords to choose from. i also know what notes are in each chord. in addition, it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing.the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys. for example, say you're playing the i, iv, and v chords in the key of c., but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in bb. all you need to do is dial the wheel to bb, find out the new i, iv, and v chords, and start playing. the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze.i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair. this is a very useful product at a fair price.no, i am not affiliated with the company at all. i'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool.in my opinion, this is a five star product. 
when set on blink, they blink way too fast. when not set on blink, all 4 lights come on and focused into just 1 spot that the combined color come out white. useless design. 
i purchased 4 of these, of the four 1 was no good on arrival another failed after 2 short time uses. i will not buy more. the first one was returned after some resistance from the seller the second one had passed the warranty time before it had failed. suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these. for the $$$ should be more deple. 
this capo isn't quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar. if i position it just so it will work as long as i don't bump it or a string will pop out of one side. 
just use a cloth or paper towel. 
my issue with the pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply. i have a voodoo lab pedal power 2 plus.the documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply. however, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.first of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board. the fitment to the power supply is there... sort of. there's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together. i wasn't worried about this, since i doubt i'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.the second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter. once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out. you'll probably have to break them. it's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.the main issue i have with this board relating to my voodoo lab power supply is this. once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board. you can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.i really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the voodoo lab power supply i own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, i wish i could return this board - except i can't, because it now has holes drilled in it. (you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it.)basically, i paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro. needless to say, i'm not very pleased. 
from the product description, i expected something far more robust than this unit. by and large, i've had great experiences with behringer pedals, but this reverb unit is the wimpiest i have ever used in 40 years of playing - no stronger than the reverb in a 5w first act amplifier. 
i bought one of these for a vintage f showman that doesn't have built in reverb. put a battery in and plugged it in. very simple. but the sound was horrible! no setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb i ever heard or would want to hear. the closest i could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful. on the other hand, the reverb from my korg ax-100g (that i was using on another rig) was great. maybe my dr600 was not functioning properly, but i don't think so. i think that's the way it really sounds. so i got a return authorization from amazon (very easy - never fails), put it back in the box and ups picked it up the next day and i got a full refund.jm tepper 
this \"would\" be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity, it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum, pluck or riff ring the reverb relatively worthless if you 'want a lot of reverb\". what the hell was behringer thinking??? 
the plastic knob that you use to tighten the ball and socket doesn't grip very well and even the lightest camera will slip and sag. it's a great idea but not well executed. 
the plastic piece that screws the wire into the as made of very thin plastic, and cracked in two within a week of light use. i guess i can redo it with electrical tape to make it work, but i have many whirlwind cables that have lasted me 15+ years. i expected more from this manufacturer, but i guess the quality is not the same as it used to be. 
often, we get what we pay for. after researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks, i chose solid items for reasonable prices.i should've known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle - the quality of the cable. this item simply didn't ever work - it arrived with a bent pen on one and even when we attempted to straighten it, it didn't connect well onto the mixer board. the microphone as a very shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic.don't buy this item - sphe relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand. 
is strictly on the aspect of a bass guitar, not regular guitar. 
if you're a metalhead, stay away!! i tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey rogue g10 blows it out of the water. this thing sounds like crap with anything distortion. it's great for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic f crunch. but if you demand metal, get far away! 
great price but unfortunately this product didn't work for me. fortunately i had no problem returning it for a full refund so overall i'm happy with the results. 
this works in some applications, but doesn't work in many others. even when detected by the software, it will not work with line 6 equipment. too bad, because it would have been convenient to program my effects with my laptop instead of my desktop. 
i tried with with my macbook pro with both mountain lion and mavericks. also with my win7 x64 machine. i tried it with a variety of midi capable gear including trying to update firmware on fx hardware, sg and receiving midi pc and midi cc, as well as transmitting midi clock in and out. i simply couldn't get this to work most of the time. active sense used on most roland products seems to kill it completely.in contrast i purchased the -mu's xmidi 1x1 tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time i use it.i should have totally returned this product. instead it's in a landfill. 
doesn't wotk with v-amp 3. doubt it works at all. red light always stays on and i've never seen the green light. 
i don't know how this will work with other midi instruments but i tried it with the roland td9 drums and although it does transmit the data, the drum map is totally off. the respective triggers (hihat, hihat pedal, etc) are translated into all sorts of wrong information and while you can manually compensate for some of it on the pc f it, it was just a freaking hassle. i needed this to be more flexible and able to record directly to my notebook (which doesn't have a midi input) but i gave up in the nd went with my desktop pc and its midi interface. 
my advice- spore and get something that will work with all applications. cheap midi may get you there, but if not you have to buy another. yep, always the gamble. 
i may have misunderstood the product description but i prefer the string tied to the f my acoustic over this. my issue is that it makes my guitar really high up when i play in a standing position and there is no way to adjust the strap the make it longer. if you play sitting down a lot then this would probably work for you. don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the product itself; it just wasn't what i thought. 
purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock martin and it just didn't fit well for me. also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove. a string style worked a lot better, was a lot easier to attach and remove, and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed. 
they have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don`t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by d addario get some real picks like dunlop tortex 
i like the jim dunlop .60mm pitch black guitar picks best. if you want your electric guitar to sound like eddie van halen, joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a boss gt-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. search google for boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. 
i have a real problem with these patch cables. i got them as a christmas gift but they don't stay in my pedals' input jacks without causing problems and having to push them in on occasion. most problematic is the connection between my ehx memory boy and digital memory man... never had problems with any other cables here, but these refuse to stay put without having to constantly adjust. 
i thought it was my jack for a while, then i noticed it wouldn't stay in any pedal. there is no \"click\" assuring that the cable is in place... and there's a reason for that, it isn't! slips right out of every pedal i have. not reliable. 
these cables are excellent quality cables, however, if you are trying to patch your pedals together in a closely spaced setup, these cables are rather bulky and stiff.the large size of the right angle connectors requires you to space your pedals out more than you might prefer, especially compared to some of the other pedal patch cables that are available from companies such as hosa. 
bought it after read reviews. i had signal loss using these cables.. it's like having a loose connection inside the cable. my connections were on and off, i thought i had a dead pedal.. i have to wiggle and hold to get signal. it's too flexible almost like twizzlers (no kidding!). if you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables, go get the one from pro co, i bought it very cheap from sweetwater on ebay, surprisingly very good quality and looks durable! 
i purchased the h4n after being unhappy with the h2's performance most significant where i couldn't record a good sounding signal that wasn't distorted with the line in jack. only to find that the h4n has the same problem but not as bad. if i try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the h4n's 1/4 inch jacks, it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal. it appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp, adjusting the gain doesn't correct it. i contacted zoom's tech support about the h2 and was told that i likely had a defective unit. i returned the h2 and decided to give zoom another chance and try the h4n after seeing many positive reviews.i really like the h4n's design, the menus and controls are nicely organized. it feels more sturdy than the h2. the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent. most other recorders in this price range don't have xlr inputs. since i plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board, if the line in jacks don't work properly and can't accept a normal line level signal without clipping, i can't use this for what i bought it for. i have used my sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems. i've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the zoom products are the only ones where i have encountered this problem. if you are using this to record with mics, it works great, but if you need to record from line level sources, the zoom recorders may not be a good choice. i exchanged this for the tascam dr-07 and while the tascam doesn't have as many bells and whistles, it is a nice recorder and i'm very happy with it. 
the boss me-70 is not as nice as the boss gt-10 and will not let you install boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. i recommetting a boss gt-10 and then install boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. now your guitar can sound like eddie van halen, joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. search google for boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. 
i really wanted this to be a great product. the screws strip out too easily. basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out. i had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon. nope. even the pop filter fell off. i love the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage... ex: adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc. otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option. just make it one solid piece. i'm tempted to try to fix it with gorilla glue because i do love the design. it's just not strong enough. not that it's a surprise though. not much of anything is worth the money these days. it's a damn chore to return every friggin' purchase these days that they don't really have to care about actually testing products. why should they? they already have your money. i feel like i should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up. besides, what are they going to do? replace it with another broke a$$ product? better yet, refund my money for the product i paid - minus shipping???? that doesn't include the time i spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place. i want a refund, plus an hourly wage. whatever, don't buy one. companies that don't test their products don't deserve your business. what would make me happy, is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question(s): did you test this product? how did you test it? what were your results? is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence?nope 
as soon as i attached my mic, and with my strong hands, i over twisted the mic holder on the threads, and the thread piece came loose on the stand. i think i can fix it with some liquid metal, but this is not as impressive as some mic stands i've had in the past. sincerely, docafter a few months of trying to make it work. it doesn't. i changed my rating from 3 to 1 this puppy is just poor quality. 
i have three mic stands, with this one being the fourth. i still have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible.1. the top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down.2. the bottom clamp never did secure properly. it kept opening up even without a mic on it. the weight of the stand itself stripped it.i sent it back without hesitation. 
so the problem with most reviews is that people generally review things as soon as they get them when they are still in the honeymoon phase about it. i've used this in my jam lab for 4 years and use it every time i play electric (about 5-7 hours a week.)the unit itself has held up well. no problems with case or pedals. all switches, knobs, plugs, & display work fine. it doesn't have a on/off switch but that's minor. it's low profile and is easy to switch by foot. i have it going into my mixer which works fine. no feedback or buzz from it.i like the recording software, cubase, that came with it. i didn't think i'd use it much but i do. it's fun and easy to record my own songs. cubase is a little quirky and will often tell me that there is an error and it needs to close, but i've learned nothing happens and it's fine.i don't use the looper much as i have it before my digitech jam man. which, if you don't have, you need it! the drum presets are fun to use. it's a blast to set a drum track, loop a rhythm, then jam on top of it. isn't that what it's all about?my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets. the tuner is not very accurate and i use a cheapo tuner that works much better. also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isn't. some flaw i guess. also the clean presets; like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak. i don't like them at all. the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone. they rock. i use alot of the other ones as well.imho this the review ...i still like it...alot!! "unixreviewtime": 1363392000, "reviewtime": "03 16, 2013"} name ron1414 review i gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day , and visually it's hard to read because the lettering is so small. also there are many function for one knob to have, a little confusion for me. the sounds are great and the recording aspect of it is nice, but not something that is best for my needs.i am looking into a boss me-25 instead, 
i used to buy a lot of wire form these guys.... however, you need to be careful and test everything you get from them on an xlr cable tester.i didn't believe it myself...i read another reviewer had an issue with xlr cables being wired incorrectly from pin to pin. so i took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables.i got through only 4 monoprice cables before i found one that was miss-wired. now i will be checking all of them for sure.not a good start though.glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on.i suggest everyone check their monorpice cables. the testers are very cheap and may show problems you weren't aware of. 
the coversion cable didnt work. t is axlr to ubs cable. i have the red blinking light syndrome also. but i learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for st back. so izm thanks hde for wasting my time. go sell your snake oil to someone else......... 
i only bought with the idea that a \"full\" version of behringer's sequence program came with it....needless to says its a \"compact version\" and for you other imac/os x users out there????----aint worth yer timeyer better off spg your money on vst's au's that will work with osx and cubase or garageband....other than that its another interface \"i guess\" as long as you want to use rca plugs to do that with...who the !$%^ uses rca to interface there analog instruments to their puter????based on the software hustle im sorta sour but if yer a pc/windows owner i would get it!!!!its about the cheapest way to \"intro\" yer way in to daw/dat interface..... mainly im talkning to katz who ownnewer macs/imacs who are truying to muddle your way thru music digital interface and keyboard sequencingfor those users yer better off buying a pizza probably... 
i have a 1953 telecaster body and after installing the screw to the pickup they were to long for the body . i had to trim them down 
these types of pedals are toys. they are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with. by all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing. if not, i recommlowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay, or distortion. 
i had a friith one of these and he loves it. i got one on his recommion and when i put the batteries in it, it started smoking. it did work for awhile. i pulled the batteries out and tried to ac adapter and it smoked again, this time it did not work. i am one of those people who gives an item one try and if it does not work, holds a grudge. i would not advise anybody to get this. 
this particular brand i've seen around and haven't heard to much about them, but the one that i got worked fine for about a couple days. it went out and i sent it in hoping to rule out the possibility that i might have gotten a bad one.and i requested in a letter when i sent it in that they snother one in exchange, that didn't work out so well, with that being the only way i could rate it and never receiving a replacement to verify that i just got a bad one, i'd have to rate this one at the bottom... 
should have paid a little more and i guess im spoiled with 2nd day...these have been ordered for a couple of weeks...you seem to wait forever to save a few bucks...i odered for some buddies and hear about it every day...hope they work when they do finally arrive..good luck 
sounds disgusting. very bright and clear highs, nothing beautiful in mids and totally muddy lows. don't hope to take chords on it. only on first 4 strings may be...try out f's mini amp if you're searching for a little thing, or but a bigger one. 
ok, i'm surprised that this unit is now over $15 0. i only spent $8.59 for this and i'm mad at myself. it was cheap enough that i rolled the dice to see if i could get away with a decent product for cheap. it feels solid, looks like a real direct box...but sounds like ass. i couldn't believe that pyle would put that much effort into a great \"fit and finish\" product, yet not put decent components inside. this is the noisiest piece of crap i've ever used - i  up buying another direct box (spent over $60 0). pyle has once again lived up to it's name, but they should finish the name properly and re-brand as \"pyle of s .\"sorry folks, but i'd skip this one. the 5-star ratings must be from employees. the only reason i didnt' give it one star was because it was so cheap (remember, i only spent $8.59), and i'm the one that pulled the trigger on the purchase.live and learn. why would i think plugging a $2000 0 guitar into a cheap piece of crap was a good idea? my fault. 
a loud hum will crescin every few minutes even if the ground is lifted. works great in intervals though, too bad those intervals are minutes. 
it stopped working after 2 gigs. i'm not sure why, but it is very frustrating. i guess you get what you pay for here. 
our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago. every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p-bass...not good. my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekhe problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself. we've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.we tried to make the f/shallers work but just could not. maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us. 
well 3 hours to put together got tiring and annoying as things to fall a part..however as a standalone items it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming on..however i am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one..i bought this in order to use with software recording for basic beats to fit my own songs..and it is a nightmaregoing on a week now no support help from either company..heed my warning if you want to use this with ni, ez drummer or other programs like that you must know how to reroute mapping of midi in order to use it. this is not a plug and play item you will spours of your time trying to get this to work with software...there is very little helpful info out on the net i've owned this for over a week and still never used it for its purpose yet being that its a stand alone item..there really is no MIDI support..im am close to giving up the fight and sg it back.alesis could have made this an amazing item and 1000 times easier if they simply created a midi out port on the module you could run into your daw and software.. 
it does not stick on to the guitar very well. trying some of the other reviews as to ways to get it to stick worked but i now have a small circle in the finish of my martin. i made mistake of attaching so wife could play rocksmith and now wish i had used cheaper guitar or better yet, bought a better pickup. 
the suction cup does not work. it looks like aged. it's very hard with room temp 70f. i removed the rubber suction cup and i have to use a big paper clipper to secure it on the sound hole edge. it picks up sound ok, but not great. 
i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic. learned my lesson. should of just forked over the money for an a/e. i have a yamaha f335 i really like. i say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so i thought i'd try it. i first picked up a transducer for about $3 and experimented. i like it, sounded good then i saw this from axl and i thought i'd try it. installing it wasn't bad except i bought a set of drill bits i didn't need for $10. so i got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright. i just wanted it for playing around at home so i didn't need real great sound quality. but sound was ok except it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves i think quick connect strap connector. my other complaint is i couldn't turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching. overall product quality is good. setup was ok. price was good. sound in my opinion needs some tweaking. 
the fact that it is passive really kills it. i just could not get any sound out of it, i tried multiple placements. i finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it. not worth the money, or the extra hole in your guitar. 
this is a hit-or-miss product. for me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well. it's not a total loss since i can reuse the n jack with the soundhole solution i  up with. it was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on. 
i've been using primarily alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spg so much for them. i figured i'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.these were the first to go on, and they were a huge step down from what i had on. the strings i took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string. they were twice as loud as these. when you take these out of the pack, they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti. they don't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do. the cons definitely outweigh the pros here.pros:-very flexible, string bare easy-easy on the fingerscons:-the most dull sound of any strings i've ever heard. especially on the low they're dreadfully lacking in rich low ound. the highs are very tinny. almost sounds like a bad recording.-your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings. it's the weirdest thing. this is especially true for the g string. it's hard to explain, but it's kind of like rubbing against something really clean, where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there's tons of squeak to boot. anyways, it sucks. grip is the last thing you want on your strings.bottom line: unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to btrings, these should not be purchased. i'll never buy again. this is the first time in my life i wanted to change brand new strings. 
if you've never had a pedalboard before i'd say pass on this one and look for one that is more user-fri. the pics and description don't show just how insanely large this is. it's too big. patch cables are crap and the power supply didn't seem sturdy enough to be kicked around.besides this, i had trouble using it (even for practice) because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals.i  up giving this one away to a frind getting a gator 'bone' and a seperate power supply. easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics/cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it's own. 
i bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps. if you want the metal sound for practice, then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill. but with the hybrid amps (vibro champ) going for not much more, you get better sounds and more settings. i am selling mine and ordered a super champ xd used in new condition for two and a half bills. this line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding. from now on its tube amps for me, even if i have to pay the price. a good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well, too. like i said, for a first amp at one bill, the line 6 isnt too bad. maybe some day i will be able to afford a princeton reverb? 
before i purchased the fbv i scoured the web to see how it works with the pod hd desktop, and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking..anyway, i lucked out and found a used one going cheap, and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the pod hd desktop & fbv express ii combo.1. first, in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express. yes, i know this sounds dumb, but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for...2. read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal.. there is no need to d/l the fbv software for this.now.. in the pod setup screens you have the option to either have the abcd buttons as abcd, or to be fs5-fs8. this behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the fbv.so.. in abcd mode you can:a) select preset a, b, c or d from the group you are currently in.b) insert a volume fx and use volume pedal...exp2c) insert another fx enabled by toe switch, and controlled by pedal as exp1d) tap temp (by tapping the currently selected preset..ie the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press/hold the current selected preset pedal)f) you have some basic control of the looper, but cannot enable it.3/10/14 edit :looper control is flawed. you can record and go to overdub, but you cannot record then play/stop the loop.. you can stop from overdub but not start the loop. seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugnice enough, but if you are like me, switching presets is way way less useful than switching fx blocks on & off. incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns od on, and delay & chorus both off, or turn one amp on and one off (channel switching).. yay!! you cry, that sounds like me so its a no to abcd and mode fs5-fs8 it is for me!..so yup in fs5-8 mode you can do that, you cana) enable/disable 4 sets of block(s) using the four pedalsb) use volume and expression options as above (ie like volume or wah, overdrive level, delay fb etc)c) basic control of looper but cannot enable itedit 3/19/14 looper control flawed as stated abovec) enable the tuner?...oh sod it. nope you can'td) tap tempo?.. nope not that either.so in summary, the express is better than nothing, but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop.. the shortboard is worth the extra, or if you are reading this before buying the pod.. get the hd500x instead. 
not so pleased with this, the seller is fine, no prob. there, its that this mic for my use is useless, it records tooo low, cant get enough volume from it 
bought for my son to do game capture voice overs. the first day it was fine, if a bit sensitive, by the third day it was broken. cheap to buy, but cheaply made. 
unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage! i tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register. the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes. 
i was looking for a portable fold-up stand that i could take to gigs and searched around. found the guardian at amazon and thought for $10, how could i go wrong? oops! wrong. the stand is sturdy and folds up nicely, but i found it next to impossible to get my f jazz bass to stand up in it. the lack of an ext support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn't blow. this is ok for a lightweight acoustic that you don't care too much about, but for for an electric guitar or bass, no way.I just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support. live and learn. 
i have an epiphone les paul and this stand does not hold it at all. the holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor. maybe it's a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric. but given that les paul is a pretty popular model of guitar, this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand. i'm rating it for what it is sold as, and for that, it gets 1 star, and only because since there is no zero. 
the technology is fine but the attachment to the instrument isn't very fri. snark rotates to any position i want, but intellitouch up being upside down. it works fine but it's inconvenient. 
this product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the akai pro website. technical support is also almost zero. akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products. customer service is basically \"if you have to ask, you should not buy this\". i asked the akai technical department which sequencer software i needed and they told me to go to a music store! this may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of midi knowledge and experience don't buy this product. try finding a midi tutorial that is usable. good luck with that chore.added 08nov2010: the keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing. i sent an email to akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts. i find that unbelievable. 
bought this rosin to see how i would like it. i have a very light hand on the bow, so i like a rosin that is on the aggressive side. this is not. since all fiddlers have their own styles you have to deal with trial & error. 
this does work as described. it arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out. the reason i only gave it two stars however is because i find it so uncomfortable! its quite hard on your collarbone. i have added foam to it and now it works well, but i suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place. 
this pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need. i would personally recommhe electro-harmonix metal muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price. 
it is entry level but only records one channel even though it is misleading with multiple inputs and outputs. it works as a beginner tool but only that. mono only. 
this was my first foray into home recording and it comes with audacityfor free. free is free, and you get what you pay for in terms of something that will not produce high qualty musical reproduction . the interface is noisy, and it requred a lot of tweaking after the fact to get a reasonable sound without distorion and humms etc. sent it back after one day. 
im starting a podcast. i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti. i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this. great for voice overs. in sound proof studios. the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise. the ability to select the 4 recording modes is great. if youll use it. i would not reccomecording 2 people at once on this. however recording a choir or something would work. but i will never do that and neither will you. this microphone only has a usb port. not XLR. so no hope of expanding. if you ever want to host a podcast with 2 people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and 2 new microphones.or you can do what i did and get 2 audio technica atr 2100's, 1 behringer xenyx 802 dual mic input mixer, 2 shock mount/broadcast boom combos and 2 windscreens for the same price as a yeti, raidus shock mount, the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand.now i can replace my mixer and keep my 2 mics, or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for 2 hosts on my podcast.do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever 
i normally tune to drop f on my 8 string, but even in standard, i just cant stand the strobe, and theres no other mode. i ordered a pitch black for $70. im still waiting on the return for this. 
the box contained a bag with just the bottom half of the stand. the top section with the mic thread attachment was missing. sent it back and did not reorder. 
i ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated. however, the bag was ripped in 3 places. the stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing. the most annoying thing was that they did not match each other. the locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights. the holes in the inner poles were drilled in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height, you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height. they looked like they might be relatively solid but i returned them anyway...bit disappointing. 
both of the stands had parts that had fallen out, or were missing all together. when the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects, this is a major concern. it may be that i got a bad box that got missed by quality control, but it does make me suspicious of pyle products. 
the material used is fine. the looks are fine. the length is horrible. this is too short for most adults that play guitar. it felt like i was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders. i attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what i could use. to me this was a worthless purchase. i just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again. 
i got a few of these as a christmas gift and they're just bad. i put them on my pedalboard where i previously had longer cables and these just didn't stay in the jack. i have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these. if i play loudly and my room vibrates a bit, the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal. awful. 
so heres the thing that no one else wants to say. the thing is built like a piece of s . it jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around. i used this 3 times and it shorted out. the lights started flashing and it got hot. i called line 6 and they determined it was bad so they opened a \"ticket\". fyi if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line 6. not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc i could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on. i wish i would have never bought this but hopefully i get a new one soon. well see how helpful they really are. 
i have always loved line 6. this product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up. it went dead. i changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead. i am sorry to say that i returned it. my akg wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs.i am really disappointed. 
i was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived. just to find out it wasn't WORKING!!! it is defective, and because i brought it to mexico, now i can't get a refund or a replacement.i will try to fix it through some local electrician or something. very dissapointing! 
one of the ball bearings designed to catch and lock the side mounted to the strap dislodged, and my very expensive f custom shop telecaster fell flat on the ground. 
sounded good. warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15. i rocked all night and loved the sound. next day i turned it on, my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out. i then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well. i changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock. id like to see a real set of jjs, im sure one of them was a dud. 
i bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes i record, the notes don't basily...if you think your will cheat the big boys harps, youll be dissapointed quickly...these are little more than toys compared to $40 dollar harps, they feel cheap but have a decent sound ...i dont know if they will last, but to make harp noises without decent b... ill use these sparingly...jim 
i play harp with some some that i perform. i found that all of these harmonica's the note's are off and it's hard to play, i have g blues harp that i compared the g harp to and the notes were a little off. the c harp was terrible. that said the only thing i like about this order is the case. i going to see if i can return them for store credit. 
too thick, no flexibility. sounds really harsh and like it is ruining my ukulele strings. tried on bass too, again with less than satisactory results. 
the picks work well with bass, but they are just too thick to use with ukulele. the pics also shed easily, making your instrument dusty in no time. 
i guess the tension on these is more than my uke was used to and when i put them on the neck became severely bowed after a day or two. sounded lovely for the first hour, that's why two stars. granted my uke is one of the cheaper lanikais, if you have a better built uke it might be able to take these but i simply can't recommersonally. 
for any usable tones while playing live, the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp. direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring.I didn't like the recorded tones either, much rather preferred amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasn't an option.that being said, it is good for practice and song writing. used this for more than a year and finally sold it! that's the other thing with items like this, they lose value real quick once the next version comes out. 
s on amazon). i own other herc stuff, and it's all ideal, and for a few bucks more, i could have had that lifelong-use stand instead of this one. oh, well, for once, i got cheap. and got burned for it.all in all, not great, this tiny stand. one stand fits not all. perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand, but i think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments. you may think you can bhe lower forks, but it's hard to do, will require a vice, and if you see on the amazon pictures, the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves, so if you splay it out like it should be, you'll change the way it fits in the grooves, and thus it won;t work at all. it's just an imperfect design. my take on it, your mileage may vary. bye bye. 
at the time i bought, was $16. mine arrived broken, so it had gone back. reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken. not upset about that - stuff happens. it is just not a good stand. light construcion, unstable (topples easily) and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped. the 'protective' materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft, shiny runner like materail and it 'sticks' to my instrument's neck. so i pick up uke and i get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity. happened every time. yes, i tried out the stand even though broken, and it proved to be a bad choice. back it has gone. 5 stars to amazon's return policy, thouh! 
let me first start off with the sizing. when they say \"fits soundholes from 33.75\" - 35\"\ they really mean it.you are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 1/16\" smaller than the specifications.i know i did. my fri oscar schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well. the edges did not \"catch\" completely and it looks terrible.my classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole, it did not fit at all. you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard.the main issue is the sound.yes, it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming, slightly but enough to tell.however, it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes.fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before, even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes.for me, that does not justify it.a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less.another thing i found out was what was amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new.the packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened. does it matter? in practical terms, no, not for this sort of item.i guess that is how amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies. 
perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound. be advised that i did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike. as strictly an issue of natural acoustics, i found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar's output and resonance. i have an aria ad-80 which is a very well-made chinese attempt at cloning a martin d-42. it can not compete with the real Martin but for the money i paid it was a great buy and it is known as a \"sound canon\" for it's great natural volume. adding the o-port deadened the lows. it just didn't provide any plus at all anywhere else. it is however pretty inexpensive so if you're a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it's not going to break your bank. but again, if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person \"voiced it\" in his or her manufacturing process, this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything. i'm an acoustic nut and i'd love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box. the o-port seemed to \"corral\" the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole. sorry to be a crab about it--i like planet waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the \"humidipak\" recall a few years back. but this product was a waste to me. 
i thought it would protect my desk but the pad is almost like that rubber they put under rugs so they won't slip around. maybe i should get that for cheaper.i accidently bought large, ooh boy is it; like, windshield sun reflector size. sort of just a personal opinion review i suppose. 
there is a problem with the design. when you move the head, the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head, just break off. the tuner itself is great, but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes. 
for some reason, this one just doesn't hit the notes right. it looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway. i have tried it several times and it just doesn't tune right. then i recheck with my other brand and it's not even close. maybe i just got a bad one? i like that this one shuts off automatically..but again, it's way off tune.i did like the style, size and color.....but it doesn't work right so it's like running with a flat tire... 
i ordered this from the amazon warehouse as a refurbished item. it was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together. the glue didn't hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel. this was unfixable so i sent it back for a refund. warehouse deals are not such good deals. 
first time i tried to use it, it broke in my hand. it is now taped together, while i wait for a different kind to replace it. 
very accurate tuner but it broke within the first week i used it. the little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break ring it useless. i will try to get a replacement... now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need. 
like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off. i tried to glue it back on, but it just fell apart even worse when i tried to do that. if you buy this, you really need to baby it! my advice is look for a more sturdy model! 
tuner works great. both by vibration and mic.only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak. mine broke off... not even a year old. 
stopped working all by itself. fresh battery didn't help.fortunately, i've another, plus a korg and an two intellitouch. (i've 2 fiddles and 3 guitars)the intellitouch is simply \"champion!\". 
...what is the sound in the background of the hissssssssssssss? my guitar i guess, but who cares? i honestly bought this gizmo for the extremely good hisssssssssssssing nothing else.a question to amazon: companies producing objects that are nothing else than a lemon shouldn't be prosecuted?p.s.i think it is \"too polluting\" for 'low cost' items to waste again in paper box, transportation, restocking work, refund work and so on. this is why 99% of the time i do not ask for my money back / but / sell this lemon on amazon, online with other websites, and in all the instrument shops worldwide in a total bad faith (while testing nobody in irig noticed the overwhelming hisssssssing?) well that is beyond me! 
no matter how many times i hard reset my 3gs, no success. there is no problem with my jack, and the phone is in pristine condition -- no problems until now. there is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work, but that's about it. i registered my amplitude app, and followed all of the instructions on the box. i tested the irig with an iphone 4 and was able to get it operating.i am giving this two stars because it did work on my fri iphone 4. but for my purposes with a 3gs, it is a brick. if anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation, i will re-rate the product. 
this is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iphone or ipad. but if you want to use it for any recording at all, even demos, i strongly recommoing for the irighd. the hd sounds waaaaaay better, and the build quality is great. this guy, not so much. there was always a bit of noise with my old irig, and it seemed to get worse over time. it also felt kinda fragile and chinsy. if you look, you can usually find the hd somewhere for $80; a $50 difference is significant, but the jump in quality (and likely longevity of the product) is definitely worth it. i upgraded and would absolutely do it again. 
bought this for a fricheap plastic enclosure. affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay. he tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay. stay away from this one and get a better used pedal. 
my review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more. when i first got it i liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first i thought it was great. then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.after all of that i finally realized i was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. go to the f forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.the thing happening with this amp i think is a few things. f guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a f, and i don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, i wanted anything but a strat body, unless i have a grand to pay for an older one, i'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and i would only get one after i got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people i've read the complaints i was trying not to realize, as i didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, but i did!and i am so glad i did. i almost got a peavey vypyr, and i am glad i didn't. this amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which i read on f's own forum/website, f acknowledges it exists, but does nothing to fix it in future models!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.i've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and i was like review s of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying \"throw away your pedals, you won't need them\" and \"i was going to get pedals, but don't need to now\ that's kind of the danger of these amps, they p making everyone sound the same! no matter what tweaking i was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.i think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and i've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but i needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.i think if i played this at a gc i wouldn't of gotten it, and i just tried to make myself like it. 
could be a fluke, but my unit was defective straight out of the box. plugged it into the macbook pro, fired up garageband and right away it's midi connectivity was intermittent. then it had some stuck notes. then it stopped being recognized at all. it still got power from the usb bus, but no MIDI, no sound. the jack was visibly wiggly, too.so, you're mileage may vary, but mine obviously had a defective usb port on the back. rather than bust it open and get soldering iron, i returned it and bought an m-audio oxygen 25 for $20 more. 
with drum pads, i basically either get 0 velocity, or max. and i have to really hammer on them to trigger. hurts after a while.likes:+ size+ assignable knobs.+ works good w/ ableton livedislikes:- drum pads!keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size.i'm looking to upgrade after a month.. want better drum pads. :-/ 
works as advertised but the keys are stiff. pads take too much presure to activate. nice that i dont need another interface to connect it to my laptop.after the first few uses the usb socket broke and fell off into the unit ring it useless. wrote to dealer that was listed as selling it to me thru amazon only to have them tell me the wrong seller was listed. i had registered it with akai already so i complained to them and they sent me a new one. i had to pay shipping back the old one to them even though it was a defective product.not recommg this product. 
this unit might be great if you have child hands - the keys on the keyboard is soooo small.. don't get this if you have man hands! wtf u[date the description akai wtf 
a dull, inept version of a tubescreamer. just sounds flat and boring. not very inspiring. at all. (then again, i never did really like ts's)....... 
really wanted to like this one, because i loved the price. there is no way this is true bypass. the one i got was defective out of the box, and so when i checked, i saw the circuitry did not support pass through. maybe it is because i received a defective one, but i still wouldn't try this brand name. i am now stuck saving up for a full tone or something. 
i honestly was not impressed. it looked cheap, sounded cheap, what else is there to say, you get what you pay for!!! another chinese copy of a tubescreamer, 
i can't say much about this product. i tried it twice. it seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings, but i really didn't notice any great change. the strings didn't sound betteer or brighter. now, it sits in my drawer and collects dust. maybe i will try it again at some point, but.... 
i honestly don't see the purpose. it doesn't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar. i've used it a few times, but don't see the benefit.edit 5/30/13:after coming back to read the other reviews, it's obvious what happened: this was shipped to me completely dry. there was no grease/lubricant qualities. it was like a dry erase pad. they need to improve their quality control. i'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star. they have to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.i would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn't dried out yet, to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out. 
the cable arrived on time and the it looked nice for ten minutes. i don\"t like how the tips screw on and off and the fabric shielding slid out of place the first time i used it. the cable worked well for about two weeks but then it lost current in the middle of a session and i lost sound. this cable is complete garbage. never again! 
i purchased this amp locally and initially, i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds. this was my first f amp as well.the presets were neat and all, but when i played around with some of the review s online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the f support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues. apparently, the mustang i and ii don't have these issues, and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp. is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? there is speculation that the lcd screen (which is not present on the i or ii) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and f doesn't seem to care...definitely try this before you buy it. you may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.this amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. i am disappointed that f hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that f reps say that know what is wrong, but i'm not taking that as a fact...), but they have acknowledged that there is \"something\" wrong.whatever... i took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and i picked up a 100 watt marshall instead. guess what? the clean channel has zero hum or buzz, even when cranked. how about that? even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise.i'll knock f for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that i'd like to try. but before i buy another f amp, i'll take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds. 
tc is very overrated.Many pedals i have out performs this in my opinion. the vintage bbds (mxr vintage delay, morley 70's echo) for example just take it. but for newer pedals i liked the mxr carbon copy and ibanex de 7 much better. 
it is ok as long as you don't bump your guitar, else boom, it hits the floor. i don't trust it and amazon has it way over priced. it will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place. 
a great idea, but pure crap in terms of functionality. if you don't have something heavy on the flat the rubber piece moves, and before you know it, your axe is on the ground. i saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight, but i'm not so hot with that idea, especially if the can is open. the lip need to extown longer, and something needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around. if i had a permanent place to mount this, i'd gorilla glue it down, but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and i'll get an extra guitar stand instead. good idea, but it doesn't work. 
i purchased this instrument brand new, on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that i simply could not ignore. it was brand new, unopened, in box. they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase. in that environment i thought it a nice instrument.however, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store, and that store was very busy and noisy. it's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.this is indeed a 6-string ukulele. it measures a bit over 28\ review . i know some will disagree. but others know exactly what i mean. this isn't an expensive instrument so one really can't expect super-fine quality at this price. however-- i paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom. as mentioned, the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and i was able to return it. i simply cannot recommhis instrument unless there are no better options-- and frankly, there are. 
allotoday went to the stores to test out the followingtascams...dr 05, dr 07 mk2, and dr 40 and, for myself, up buying nothing...their differences for your ears...are....dr 05, this is a good quality toy...no line in...use its own mic, you will be ok with this, for meetings, etc.not really that good for music...can be done, but not as good..if you use ext mic...u wont be happy either...high background hiss noise relative to all 3.dr 07etc etc...only slightly better than 05...all else same...dr 40 was much quieter in noise level...be it...in mic, ext mic or line inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars...this can be used to ( semi ) record music too.so, testing on their own mics...that last one was far far better than the first two...for those wantingline in...means only that dr 40...however,my tests involved checking sound quality of bit more seriouslive recordings...took output from our zoom r 24 recorder and input that to the dr 40...upon comparing the resulting cds...a / mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd, vs...b / recorded dr40 and printed to cd...the sound was obviously better with a /no need to buy any a/d recorder attempt at this price level ,if one is looking for semi serious master recorder...my budget must be tripled at least...and then to go out to test some more !no cheap way, is there....for those curious, the whole idea has come from wanting to connect 2 units of zoom r24, not wanting to use computer software, taking the 4 outputs from these two into a clean mixer or analog sum box, and getting them downto 2 channels, and finallly to some mastering digital recorder....hoping perhaps the tascam ss r100 or r200 might do the trick,in the tests to come....many thanks, and may your camels always have two humps !k 
i ordered one of these (from mf) and had to st back because it was damaged and the latches didn't all work. even in perfect condition it's still a subpar case. but the one i got had two ripped corners on the lid, and from those rips it's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around, and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing. as for the latches (buckles), there are three of them and on the one i had only one worked to keep the case closed. the other two latched, but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.disregarding those flaws it's still obvious that it's not a good case. the hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment, the handle is not comfortable to hold, and the whole thing bin a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag. it also won't stand evenly on if that's important to you).on the positive side it's light, it does fit a telecaster ok, and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment. but do yourself a favor and spnother $25 and get something better. i have a musician's gear dreadnought case and this doesn't compare to that one at all. 
right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was way off (fretted e note on the 12th fret too sharp). after the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. next, i proceeded to adjust the intonation. i was able to get the intonation for the a, d, g, b, and high-e strings spot on. however, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted e note on the 12th fret was still sharp.i also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string f the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string f the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-e string intonation.i love the red burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). unfortunately, i'm going to have to return it. i'm going to get a squier strat instead (with either amapleorrosewoodneck).---[update november 15, 2013]i ordered the squier strat direct from amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. i contacted customer service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until december. then, to my surprise, the squier strat was delivered yesterday! yay!! :d the happiness!!i was able to get the squier perfectly intonated. it's red burst like the legacy (f calls it antique burst). it's a beautful guitar and and i'm loving it! 
... "unixreviewtime": 1332806400, "reviewtime": "03 27, 2012"} name reviewer review just use a smartphone to record stuff. this is a really weird, not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones. not really worth the $75 - i returned mine. 
i was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time, good though they were. too expensive foronly one effect at a time. returned it. 
well... it's not really too expensive, but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it. even the crunch button is just a louder sound? not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you're looking for. guess that's why it's so cheap. 
it is built like a tank, but it quit working after a couple of weeks. i haven't made time trouble shoot it yet, so i'm not sure what component has failed. 
this product is bad quality because the noise it makes. it increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all. i'm going to sell this product. i didn't like it. 
downgrade to 1-o star after returning it back to brookmays, the seller:i am really disappointed by the seller, brookmays', ignorant responses to my return of the defective cherbub guitar pickup, which picks up unwanted noise by the wire's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won't have the same issue. after two weeks of the returned item was delivered, i didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so i emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap. too bad, four days after the email had been sent, i only got the email of telling me the case# of the message i sent without any further response to my refund. until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and i don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money i spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. therefore, yesterday, i emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to amazon about the bad after-sale service i ever have before if i still haven't heard from the seller shorty.today, i finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, review after using it twice:i like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings. besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description \"regardless the surrounding noises.\" i have distressed from those unwanted loud noises. one more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that i use, and i have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. however, when i switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either. i don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup i got ... i bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, i can't accept the noises and i have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. so, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, brookmays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description. good luck then! 
this is more of a toy than a good pickup. it functions but doesn't sound great. what did i want for this price anyway? 
first we have to realize this is not a $200 pickup or even a $50 pickup. it's less than ten bucks.it has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar. as such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole. it also will to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole, as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.it is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices. unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4\" to 1/4\" coupler (to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord). you will need such extension as this tto have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.it is a passive pickup, so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device. if you don't have a preamp system, this will do you no good.So because of the limitations i rate it as above. for what it does though-- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments, it does okay. i believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money, including adhesive-disk mikes. i would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from. but this is a slightly different concept (removable) that for the price is worth checking in to. 
i bought this to use on my f p-bass. it is not reliable for me, sometimes it works and sometimes it can't find the low note correctly. i'm still using my roland stomp box tuner. glad this was inexpensive, it was not worth the hassle to return, i gave it away. 
i am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments ... wanted to like this ... but ...first the positives:- looks great- nice, easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice pricenow the significant disappointment:- inaccuratethe settings were on a-440 but every time i tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing, the tuning was sharp ... i tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... i have used the old planet waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since d'addario now owns planet waves products, they have discontinued the tuner i like and only offer the ns mini tuner (it has its place i guess, but i much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision imo) ...i haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now i will keep using my old planet waves models ...bottom line, no matter how nice the snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard a-440 ... having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation ... 
i own the sn-8, which btw, is the best tuner i've ever used. i bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin. so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin. i was also intrigued by the &#34;tighter&#34; tuning aspect of the bars on this. let me tell you, if it worked, the bars may have been a cool feature, but when you are fine-tuning an a string and it tells you you are on e (when you know you are on a bc the other tuners all say a, and it matches the piano), then there is a problem. i could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing, so it looks like it's just defective. the one i received was completely useless.I am amazed at the great sn-8...i am disappointed in this thing. i must have just received a dud (i hope, since these usually get good reviews), but i will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly. on the flip side, i will be getting another sn-8 in it's place, since i know those are great tuners & i love the one i already have. 
there is almost no difference between this and the snark sn-1, and by that i mean the design flaws. you have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading, and they eat batteries like crazy. the snark sn-8 is far superior. 
can't believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector. i have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector. this is now a boat anchor. to buy a 3 meter cable from them, they charge $40 for the cable, $15 to ship it and then tax. the extortion here is almost monster cable like. these folks should be embarassed. 
this gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an ipad or iphone or a computer, but the particular one i received has a defective input socket for a 1/4 inch audio plug. it doesn't snap in place. just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out. that makes it fairly useless. i may have simply gotten a defective one. 
what was thought to be a doa model,  up being a mistake on my behalf. my iphone 4s, which i have had for about a year now, must've had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine...unless trying to use the jam.in the box: comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps.it comes with the jam and two cables (usb and ios). it is bigger than i had imaginedit's almost the length of an iphone. feels nice, and is very light. the cords aren't very long. 
the velcro itself is insanely amazing. its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing. if you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men, then by all means, use this stuff. in the you just can't make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board. once together, it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably. i cannot think of a practical application for this velcro. 
i tried this in front, in the middle, and at the f an effects chain, as well as by itself, plugged into the effects loop of my mesa boogie mark v amplifier. whenever it is in the path, as soon as i engage my effects loop, the signal level drops considerably. it did not matter whether the pedal was on or not. the chorus effect is good, but i don't want my volume to drop every time i turn on my effects loop. i have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that i use, so i can't raise the sny more. 
the hde xlr to usb is ubs. i have the same problem the red blinking syndrome. i learneda long time ago dont try to fixsomething you paid for st back. so i did thanks hde for wasting my time. go sell your snake oil to someone else.....i 
this cable was very affordable, but you get what you pay for. it sounded brilliant while it wasn't broken, for about the 4 hours of runtime. it works if it isn't abused at all, but if you abuse it in any way at all, your out an xlr cable. i do not recommhis product at all for heavy usage. 
well... its a stand.. its super cheap and i don't mean the price. the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back.. i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back. its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well. instructions were ok.. came with more parts than what were required... all holes filled and i have of of each part extra.. the guitars do not sit very well in this stand... i will use it until i can find a better one.. it will get replaced.. i really should shis pos back to amazon. the concept is great but the execution of it sucks. it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand.. there are better options out there for something portable. this stand is worth 10 0 tops... if i had it to do all over i would save my money. 
this stand is ok for light home use. i would not recommhis thing for gigging or travel. very cheaply made but does the job. guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot. you must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on the rack. avoid if you can spore. 
i really like epiphone products. they are well-made, easy to play guitars. i also purchased an ep les paul special 2 ebony from amazon a while back. but, i received this uke defective. i expected when i plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but i couldn't here anything at all. totally dead. there are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down. i'm disappointed because i expect gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory. i actually bought this guitar for a frind was very embarrassed when i got over to his house and it didn't work in front of him. i just requested a return/exchange from amazon. if the next one works ok i may buy a second one for me. i seem to have bad luck with electric-acoustic guitars when purchased through amazon. i had to sack my dean 12 string elec-acoust to amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem. i do want to state that this is a beautiful uke with nice feeling nylon strings, fine wood high polished surface, high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically. the actual guitar looks even better in person than in the picture. if this uke was working 100% i would have given it a 4 or 5. 
i sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and i see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap, but i don't know why. maybe other people don't really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before. it wasn't too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds, but once i got it on it was stiff and felt odd. it was very uncomfortable around my neck and i took it off my guitar in a matter of matters. i would honestly recommpg a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap. unless you're just going for something that is inexpensive, does the job, and isn't designed for comfort. 
i ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap, the first one arrived in non working condition, wires inside werent even soldered, so i ordered a replacement, plugged it in and it didnt work either, the second wasnt soldered either.i know its cheap, but i expected it to at least work, do not buy 
it was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china. any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell. if you can wait a month for delivery or longer, if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up. if you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too. i have decided to build my own 
it did not perform. looks cool, but thats it. very large and inconvenient. would not recommhis because i would not recommhe blue yeti. 
this is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there. i play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen. it worked but i don't use it anymore. 
compared to the snarksnark sn-1 tunertuners, i really like the low profile / leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. the snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. this works much better in that regard. this one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. it mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine. tuning accuracy? hard to say- it just indicates high / low / on pitch, really. i prefer the more precise and wider scale +/1 readout of the snark. they are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. but this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.the negatives, and why i can't recommt are as follows. the battery cover on mine fits very loosely. i worry the battery will fall out very easily. i may p gluing it in place. it isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up i think). the second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpular to the user- that's right, sideways. on a bass, i don't really need it to tell me which string i'm plucking or tuning, but i still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it. it wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow. i just can't for the life of me work out why they designed it this way. 
the device itself is difficult to read in bright light.my first one arrived not working at all.the second one arrived with a low battery. what? after three days the battery goes out.i would have returned it, but lost it because it doesn't adhere to the headstock very well. you've been warned. 
50+ years playingmy pedal is unuseablethe lower strings are all mush at any gain or eq settingread all the good reviews and watched all the videosmine sounds nothing like themmaybe defectivei also own the joyo british and joyo crunch and they are flawless 
i bought this with the idea i was getting a pedal that would give me usable marshall amp sounds. after trying for a couple of hours, i find that it won't do that. i guess my combination of guitar and amplifier wasn't meant to be used with this pedal. the guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control, he was spot on about that (very annoying effect). nothing but praise goes to the supplier ( kdm distributors) . they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country. but the pedal itself, not for me. 
wow, the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry, but plug in some real mics and voila- the dr-40 becomes something special.... but, i do not always want to carry around so much equpment, and was hoping for better internal mics.honestly, my super cheap olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing.and why is the line-out so darn noisy!? must be defective. oh well... gonna, have to shis back. 
.the 2i2 is a simple set-up. pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a \"low-headroom\" instrument to it, run the usb cable to your computer and set it up within the daw described parameters. it would have been nice to know that the included plug in suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with ableton live lite and that it could be found it in the plug-ins section of ableton, but i figured it out eventually regardless. (ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!i wasn't sure for a very long time if this was user error, an ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, i screamed \"ballsdogit!!!\ and purchased a license for reaper. after going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new daw over the last few months, i began to realize that my monitors no longer \"lock up\ but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!i had to tweak the living daylights out of reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. now i'm in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers. garbage focusrite! everyone i know that has reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. i have yet to experience a crash, but i also have yet to experience any recording time.seriously, i started reading on the reaper forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from david@focusrite actually saying that \"you should not use this setup to record electric guitar..\ and that if you need to record electric guitar you should \"get something with more headroom like the 2i4.\" that is just unbelievable in my eyes!i'm sure i could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should i have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? besides that, i'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. there was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and i researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. i feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. how in the heck does this thing have a nearly 5 star rating!!!????the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. i have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. i constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the focusrite scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here. 
hi folks! ok, this thing is cheap. that's cool. but a cheap item you can't use is money thrown away. before buying this i had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it's too small. well, i want to clear this up once and for all. it is too small! specifically, it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so (depg on your guitar), and it doesn't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret, even on a skinny neck. this thing really is a puzzler. i mean, who the hell would make capos this size, especially when they could've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price? someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid. however, a positive from this whole mess is that i finally found a capo to use with my ukulele, and for way cheap, ha ha. but if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size, this is utter garbage. cheers! 
this isn't a terrible tuner, and for how cheap it was, it wasn't a \"ripoff\". however, it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim. when it does work, it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner. however almost all of the time it's fluttering around to completely different notes or just not reading a single thing. i try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and it's the same. it also did not come with batteries, and replacement ones aren't cheap and are very hard to find. i don't think this is a terrible product due to the low price, but if you want to be taken seriously and take your own music seriously, get a real desktop tuner. a cheapo one is only 5 bucks more and you can find real, full sized, affordable batteries for it... 
tried this and was not happy. seemed to want to be off too much. got the f ft-004 instead. this one does have a great view on the led, but if it doesn't tune right, what's the point? i would try the f. just a note. if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner. i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing. just a thought. 
i have had 2 of these tuners (you'd think i'd learn after one). they calibrate okay , it's just that they to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device (both of mine broke this way). to me, for the price, it's made cheaply. try d'addario instead; love their tuners. 
i know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here. the unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a rode m1 mic or similar.i knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot, but i opened one, tried to use it and can't. it was a total waste of money, but doesn't pay to return it. i suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it, it might serve your purpose. again, you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands. 
the adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap, a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately. replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand. they are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting, good enuf okay i guess. but after transporting and reset, i found them to be junk. 
big disappointment. i've been so impressed by epiphone's but this one didn't do it. quality of manufacture and assembly great. pickups far less than inspiring. yes, it's a great platform but was so expecting those p90 sound. i may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it. just didn't have the tone and bite i was expecting.i could certainly invest in some pup's but i have too many great p90 guitars to bother. roll of the dice i guess. 
installed these on my schecter c-1 hellraiser. i had very high hopes for these, but as with any new over-hyped technology, they failed to impress me. the only good thing i have to say is the tone is good. but realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings. you would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison. so now that i have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse. they are not silky smooth feeling as advertised. if anything they feel worse than regular strings. last but not least: they are bad for frets. just like stainless strings; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick. i don't know about anyone else but i don't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.for the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear. 
kripes man..the one time i go and actually buy a \"honer\" and its a \"bummer\" this thing has 3 keys off tune!! i can buy stuff 10 times better quality from chinaand never have this kinda junk. maybe it's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and i 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan ive never got a harp this trashy b4!...... all i can say is buy merana's for tryin out buy \"suzuki\" or swan\" from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you'll be better off. oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again--- you can get a \"mississipi river harp\" for only $5.oo if you have a \"burke's\" outlet near you!they're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho---- the doctah has spoken! :) 
not really bright enough. both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same. i would look for something else if i didn't already have this. ok for reading a small book in bed, but doesn't cover the sheet music brightly enough. 
i bought this brand because i have one of their mic stand mounts (for iphone) which i like a lot.pros:the clips did a good job holding my ipad mini without having to remove the folio type cover (marware axis).quality seems acceptable for the price, the ball swivel works well.cons:it's too heavy for my mic stands. i tried it on the boom arm and it made it top-heavy and unstable. if the boom is positioned in a very upright position it's ok, but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose!the clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome.i had high hopes for this one but it's not going to work for me. i have returned it and ordered a different chargercity model, the one with the lever-type mount. 
this product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside. upon receiving mine and assembling it, it broke immediately while i was trying to mount an ipad onto it. it also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability. the metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle. 
first time using item and it broke. the round back that screws onto the mic stand broke. i was really excited to have this and us it now that i transferred all my music sheet to my ipad. as soon as i took it off the mic stand the round piece came off. would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review, but it only kept referring to delivery. i do like the product and it did hold my ipad steady even with a leather case on. sad! 
this review is on the seller yorozuya yokoshima ,not the product. these people posted what seemed like a good price (not ridiculously low) on the us dream pedal. it was to be shipped from japan. they then decided the price was an error and canelled my order. this kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on amazon.com because the item was less than $4 0 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers yorozuya yokoshima were afraid they wouldn't make a killing on the item. i am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior. i lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident. 
a very boring, dull, uninspiring pedal. don't waste your time with this. a boss sd-1 or digitech bad monkey are far better options for this price range. 
i've owned more than one overdrive pedal in my 30 years of playing guitar and the only one i still have on my pedal board is the boss super overdrive...sweet baby is well on the way of living up to that legs well. i have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal. it really does react to your playing style. unlike other overdrive pedals i've used this one really gets smooth when you back off of your string attack and starts to growl the harder you dig in. as far as the pedal goes it is pretty much the same as a lot of them...instead of a tone knob they call it \"focus\ there is also a volume and drive knob. the sounds i can get out of the sweet baby are some of the best i've ever used and easy to dial in. i own a lot of pedals but lately i keep my chain setup real simple...the guitar goes into a ehx-crying tone wah pedal, then the sweet baby, then a boss super overdrive (used as a lead solo gain boost... i don't use distortion pedals.), next is an mxr micro chorus followed by an mxr carbon copy analog delay. the whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my f deluxe reverb amp. i use the foot switch that came with amp to turn on the tremolo when needed... i play mostly blues and classic rock. the sweet baby is well made and i don't see it failing me anytime soon. you can spundreds more on name brand pedals but what works for me at the f the day is alive and well in this \"clone\" overdrive tone bl...update: this pedal has since been returned. it went out with me on a few gigs and didn't hold up to life on the road. the connections inside the box came loose and became a major problem before a few gigs...i have since put my boss super overdrive back in the chain...while i truly loved the tone from this product in the ou get what you pay for. 
let me just start out by saying that i've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. i still own most of these units except for this one...the joyo compressor. my setup is a very simple one...starting with a stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah, super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front f a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. i don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals i've tried over the years but i know why you want one and how to use them. this thing simply didn't work right out of the box. while the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from china. loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. i  up sg it back for a full refund. i don't in anyway blame the seller. they took care of me without a hitch and i would buy from them again...just nothing with the name joyo on it. if you're only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for. 
the unit i received did not work. i returned it. i like the other joyo pedals i ordered so i am going to give this one another shot. 
although this is a very solid feeling pedal and the output and sustain knobs worked, the attack knob (the control for how much compression you want to apply) did absolutely nothing. i even checked it in my recording software by looking at the waveforms and there was no change at all regardless of the attack setting.perhaps my pedal was a rare defective one, but none-the-less i returned the pedal back to amazon and will search for another compression solution for my pedal board. 
it seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp. not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk. when received the package did not appear to be damaged, but i have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument. 
can't hold tightly on 1st string (low c), a little buzz. 
update: received 6 of these. 5 are ok but one has a bad weld joint at the top retainer. it was held by only one small tac weld.i got what i paid for. cheap price and cheap product. no excuse to make this kind of low quality guitar stand, putting a $500 guitar on this is asking for guitar damage when the stand falls apart. not worth the time & $ to st back to amazon. one star only for this product. good chance that you will get a crappy one if you order this. less than one star for this piece of ...... 
this is a cheap stand and i was not surprised to see it had broke less than 2 day after it had arrived. the top cup that holds the neck of your guitar was welded in one spot only and it was very thin metal where the weld was made. i do not recommhis product. 
i dont know what all the hype is over this thing. the idea is good and its cute. its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out. how many of these types of noise boxes do we need? not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it. go buy a 20 watt roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also. or any combo little amp. it's for bedroom use only. you have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire. being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you. just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot. 
i have checked this amp out twice, once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 8&#34; version, with both a strat and a les paul, and i am very disappointed in this amp.now admittedly, with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre-amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 5-7, however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones.so, without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing...bottom line: unless you want full on distortion 100% of the time, you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp.... if you are committed to orange (and boy do they make some stunning amps) go check out the dark terror... 
when i originally went out to place this order, i was planning to order the tc electronics singles voicetone c1 vocal effects processor for its pitch correction function. as i looked over that device and some alternatives, i finally ordered the tc-helicon mic mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects. i ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect - how could tc electronics put out the &#34;mic mechanic&#34; with a pitch correction function that didn't do anything? well, those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has no EFFECT! also, i couldn't see any effect between engaging/disengaging the tone button. i kept the mic mechanic because i like the other effects, but i'm very disappointed in the primary reason i bought it! 
if you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static, non-oscillating, chorus like effect, it's fine for that. as an actual pitch shifter though, this thing is awful. all the pitch shift settings sound like they're 30 cents sharp. this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect. i suppose i could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but i did not want to void the warranty so i just returned it. it's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is. i've read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also. this is really too bad because all the other pedals for mooer seem to be quite good. i own their reecho delay pedal and quite like it and i'm also tempted to get their green mile pedal.if you're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies, this pedal maybe fine for you but i doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals. it does not stick to the adhesive on any of the velcro strips i've tried to use. 
i got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue: when i record a track either with the review after doing a few recordings. but, i would say if you've just updated to ios7 or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit, you might want to hold off on that upgrade. update: got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my ipad, as suggested by a focusrite support tech, and still have the problem i discussed above. so, this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me. if anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution, please let me know. 
no manual. you can print one off the internet but it should come with one given it's price. i purchase such so i could lay down a rhythem track then go into the solo while attempting to play live. don't believe this is what it is mean't for. a simple delay looper will suffice. this can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs. 
for the price i can hardly complain, but unfortunately the item was not the correct size for a f strat replacement. checked it against my american standard, mim strat and squier and it would not fit any of them. should have just used one of my dog's chew bones and cut it myself, would have been more accurate. 
i have been using this gig bag for the past few months. if i do the math, i probably didn't use it more than 10 times, basically from home to the subway, from the subway to the studio and back, so maybe 20 minutes walk each time. so i used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes, mostly carrying it on my shoulders, sometimes by one of the two handles.then the side handle started coming apart: the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used. it will be ok for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking (which i kind of expect at this point!). meanwhile i'm going to buy another (sturdier) gig bag.save your money and get something better than this. 
this thing is crap right out of the box it had holes in the stitching and all the pockets were sown on crooked. what can you expect for $20 tho. this was a temporary solution i don't recommhis for long term use it will probably fall apart. 
manufacturer's website claimed that this case would fit a les paul style guitar. i have an esp eclipse. not even close. chromacast products are great. they need to fix the info on their web page. i'm not a fan of shaped les paul cases. too bad. 
returned this item because the zipper was already broken when i received it. not durable! sp few more dollars, it is worth it. 
a great little package for the price, but unfortunately, the zipper failed the first time i tried zipping it up. i have a standard size acoustic guitar, but be aware, the fit was snug, but not tight. 
straight out of the box this product reeked cheap. no directions inside or on the box. i messed with it for about 5 minutes. i would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic. i read the description but it did not say cheap. live and learn. 
amazon and tc electronics will not tell you that you need a 9v power supply. i didn't see any warning or advise in the point of purchase, nor in the package. this is an unfair practice from amazon and tc electronics. 
ever...my first \"less-than-5-star-review\" ever...same as others, switch failed less than ten days of owning it. used less than ten times total, light use at home, i wasn't even wearing shoes! by the way, a gigging/recording musician for over 25 years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff. bummer too great idea....poorly executed.i will not buy anther one. i will not recommo other musicians. 
soooo bummed. i simply love the sound on these cans, but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface (not deep enough in the cups) and press down hard on my ears. the max time i can wear them is like an hour, and then i can't wear them for a day or so due to residual pain. i guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups, that might help. also, on most of my other phones, the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces, while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet. so it's kind of like double trouble. however, these really do have great sound (especially the tight bass clarity). if it weren't for the discomfort factor, i would be using them all the time. as of now, i hardly use them at all. in fact, when i first tested these out, i was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more. but i'm glad i waited to really give them a more prolonged test. of course, we are all of varying shapes and sizes, ha ha, so they might work for you where they don't for me. if so, you've got a bargain on some great cans. if not, ouch. cheers! 
i love tascam gear, and have used it for nearly 30 years. i was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do. unfortunately, i was disappointed.while the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good, the actual function with the computer left much to be desired. also, the complete lack of a manual with the one i got made it very difficult understand the functions. (sorry, but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 cds of software, how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install cd?)there was a very small quick start guide included, which basically just named the various switches, inputs, and outputs, and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen. i was forced into trial and error to see if i could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode. i could not. i could record and layer multiple tracks (i was using audacity, didn't want to install cubase), but i could not get playback from the previous tracks while i also had live input. now this could have been my computer or audacity, as it is an older win xp machine, but it played back multiple tracks without problem.there was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this, or even hint where one should look, other than going to tascam's web site. i'm sorry, but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive. there should be a complete manual, at least in pdf, included with the product. if i am going to use this to do serious recording, the last thing i want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website, or worse, from \"user community\" threads in some blog.which brings me to another minor complaint - no Linux drivers included. i use mostly linux, with only one windows machine for software which i can't get on linux. i wanted to try the software under wine on linux but was under time constraints.then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware. with a hardware mixer, i can access as many controls as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time. computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time, and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls. the controls on this interface were very fussy, and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react. i found it very tedious, and again, no actual instructions were included to help with that process. with a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case? (yeah, i know, touch screens are cool.)also, software based functions are always limited by your computer and os, and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain.i am old school, and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful. i know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers, and saving space, etc., etc. i value function over fashion, however, and that is what i have always liked about tascam gear: it was supremely functional. this software falls far short of what i expect from tascam, and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable.good mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. the layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first, and takes some time to get comfortable with. old tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording, which was helpful to aspiring recording artists. not so here.i had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars, but sadly, it only rates a 2 (2.5 if i could) for me. come on, tascam, you can do better than this. 
the concept of this guitar stand is great, and i thought it would be perfect for my two telecasters...that is until i get the stands in place and put the guitars in them. the stands have a very deep angle, and from what i could tell, the guitars were sitting about 40 to 45 degrees back.it just looks silly, like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand, or are in a slow-motion fall backwards. it also up taking up way too much space, as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes. i  up returning these stands, but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version. 
cheap. the best way to describe this stand. it serves it's purpose but sp few shekels more on a better guitar stand. 
the tascam th-2000 headphones are like putting a pair of studio monitors on your ears! they are great! excellent bass response (not muddy at all), tight mids, and clear highs. to boot, they are extremely comfortable as well. the foam fits nicely around your ears, conforming to the contours of your face. they are adjustable, so if you have a huge head you can still wear these. the only drawback that i can see, and i don't really even consider this a negative, is the coiled cord. some people may not like that. all in all these are great headphones - i have listened to all varieties of music with them, monitored recordings with them, etc... excellent! by the way, they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background, making the music come out clearer. kudos to tascam for making such good headphones!may 12, 2014 update these headphones quit working after just a few months of working properly. i have a couple pair of inexpensive behringers that have lasted through more abuse and are still working. what a disappointment!!! 
i purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my roland gr55 (which has a flawless basic looper built in, but only 20 seconds record and no undo). i had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that i wouldn't need to carry a power adapter along.the factory battery lasted about 1 hour. the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes. i started recording a loop with another (3rd) fresh battery (tested 9.10 v with a multimeter) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording, suggesting that it was faulty. the lights started coming on and off randomly (record/undo/all three together, then off, then undo on, then all three on etc. etc.)the first time i used the jamman xt (with the factory battery) it seemed to be working ok and all i can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.i am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything, so i know it was not my poor technique. the main problem was that it didn't matter how hard i tried (even if i did a manual fade out) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the f the loop and the start. this makes the unit useless.also, it is poorly conceived in that, to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.the potential for damage here is very high. also, replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board. to save a few dollars digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible (read inevitable) damage.i have owned quite a few digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.it's going back to the store where i purchased it. 
i really wanted to like these, but they're a frickin, lint-catching sticky frickin' mess! they went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a new york minute, have never seen the light of day, and may have been thrown in the garbage. save your money. we use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now. 
the larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so i thought this might be the answer. the answer is to treat your larger snarks nicer cause this thing on the back of your guitar with no adjustments simple doesn't cut it. i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display. i'm quite disappointed and it sits here with no use. it is cheap though. still to me it was money out the window. 
the tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo i've ever used - and i've tried many over the years. but what was ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem, including the pick clip and tuner holder, protude outward away from the fingerboard? it's awkward to apply and remove quickly. it's visually distracting for player and audience, and it doesn't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.the only possible justification i can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck - but even that doesn't fly. regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and, unless you're avoiding playing that first fret (or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position) you're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand. i own the older planet waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.otherwise the construction of the ns artist capo is superb. the surface is arched, probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various strat fingerboards as well as a flatter sg/lp style. it doesn't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my martin om-1 which is virtually the same as a classical. if i cranked the tension it's possible the rubber would flatten out but i wouldn't risk marring the neck wood.i tried both the pick and tuner clips and they're functional, but to be honest i wouldn't use either - too distracting and i only use tuners to get an initial a, then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments, depg on what they are.the only other capo i've ever used that protudes outward is the kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence' design. i have one and, as good as the holding action is, i've never felt comfortable with the design. the older planet waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.to top off the confusion, the picture on the front of the cardboard card the ns artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that's impossible with this capo! 
i am a fan of planet waves ns capos, but this new one is not very well designed. the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards. i find my left hand hitting the lever when i'm in open position. frustrating. it does have a pick holder, which can be handy, and a place to put an ns tuner, which can also be handy. i just think it could have been better designed. i don't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff. i'll stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser. 
i was looking forward to trying these, as i've loved this company's product since day one.but i think they've messed around with the gauge, slapped a meaningless &#34;hd&#34; tag on, and added a few bucks to the price. more profit in someone's pocket for marketing jargon.i have a smaller-bodied guitar, so these should have, by their claim, given me better balance, but imho, the opposite happened. the bottom dropped out, the top topped sizzling, and the middle strings totally took over when i strum with a pick.when i play with fingers it's better, but not worth spg more money on than the normal 12s i've been using (which i think i liked a lot better).it's possible that these work great on the taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for (color me skeptical), but i'd say if you're happy with what you have, you need not try these.again, long-time user and big fan, but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly &#34;hd&#34; moniker... no thanks. 
i bought this to use with my keyboard. i wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. it doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what i'd always used. doesn't have the same feel either. nowhere close.in my opinion, a sustain pedal like the m-audio sp-2 sustain pedal with piano style action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. the price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. the only thing i've found the yamaha fc-5 sustain pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where i keep my electric guitar pedals. 
i didn't expect this cable to be so thin. it's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable i've used. not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference. if i had the foresight i'd sp couple extra bucks on a thicker cable. still, it works and was inexpensive.edit: 6 months later and it's dead already. wire frayed at the right angle jack. you get what you pay for. 
it hums, crackles, and i think i'm having problems with my equipment. as soon as i use any of my other cords then the problem is gone. hosa makes some other products that have good value. but based on my experience i don't recommhis one. 
i'm a pro-cheapo and i hated this thing. they're noisy, and the cables feel really cheap, gummy-like. drop few more bucks and get something else! 
i bought this for my canon vixia hf g10 video camera and a shotgun mic that i recently purchased for it. i needed a 12&#34; wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic (which is mounted on the mini advanced shoe) to the microphone plug on the video camera...the wire on this thing is not 1 foot long. the actual wire is under 8&#34; long itself. i would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... i'd have rated it 1 star, but i tried it on my nikon d3200 (shoe mounted shotgun mike) and it worked out ok. still a tight fit though (since there's only 8&#34; of wire)...i'd recommnyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.also, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but i hear a hiss when recording. again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the dslr or not (or my shotgun mic). 
i got 3 of these to plug xlr cables into the 1/4&#34; jacks on my board. i got it because my board only has 6 channels with xlr inputs. none of them work. perhaps i got the wrong thing? 
received it in time, standard blister packaging but the cable stopped working after 45 days. since i was out of 30 days return time, sent an email to the manufacturer but no response till today. 
these things are terrible. one wouldn't fit in my soundboard, another wouldn't lock in my mic. plain and simple....if your looking for crap that doesn't work....buy this. 
the handle and spring strength make this uncomfortable to place on the guitar, and i feel rushed to clamp on the capo because it's unpleasant to use - hurts the fingers. it's cheap and easy to use. it'll do the job, but i don't like it. 
it's good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price 
the epiphone les paul guitars don't particularly sound that great, but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price. if your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar, but you're not completely sure if they will stick with it, if you can spnother $100 and get a used mexican made f strat or tele. the reason for this is because for 1, if they decide it's not something they want to do anymore, you can resell it at the same price you bought it for (as long as it is still in decent condition) and little no money is lost. second, if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a &#34;better&#34; or more high uitar, mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. i have a couple different high uitars and i will not get rid of my mexy strat because it sounds great still. i'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this. 
this is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, you want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it. why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me. this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hx would use. boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.these things are built with heavy metal, it should last, i kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion 
from greg abrams review, entitled review is to give newer players some information. you have plenty of options for distortion pedals, the ds-1 is not the only thing out there that's affordable. find something you truly love and buy that. if its the ds-1, one of the pedals i've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to you. 
here's the deal with this pedal. it is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. in my opinion, for spg less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the mxr badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it. 
if you want your guitar to sound like eddie van halen, joe satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a boss gt-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. search google for boss gt-10 patches by james limborg. 
these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg. all the other guitars i own have schaller buttons on them and i have one main strap i use for all of the guitars. i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out. not twenty min later i was removing them and putting schaller buttons in their place. here the 3 major reasons i did not like them over schaller:1- bulky. they stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- problems engaging. i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. it wasn't until i forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- cheap. they just feel cheap. thin metal is used in comparison to the schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.for a few bucks more i'll stick with schaller's. i have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail. 
. once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. so if you are stuck with a set, here's what i recommo to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1\" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (they are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)put the screw into an electric drill (pointy n) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. it doesn't need much. i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. while you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.install with the new screws as normal, and recommhat your fritry a different brand! 
sorry, i don't like these as they're just too big. they stand out too much. they do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. there are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap. again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. i also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like i should be wearing big purple platforms when i play. not cool. 
the thing is that they don't seem to stay! i mean, you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic &#34;arm&#34;, but it doesn't stay where you put it. and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality. but, i think if you're lucky if just might get the job done. 
i purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. i would have returned it but i completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed). 
wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is much better...avoid this!! 
i ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? i ordered it \"new,\" and it definitely shows signs that it not new. first, the package was stapled, that's right- stapled together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. when i order something new, i expect it to be new. based on this product alone, i would not recommuying from this seller. 
well, what can i say? based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. however, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. the cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). and before you ask, &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;, all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. so it is definitely the cable :(anyway, i gave it 2 stars because while it was working it sounded great through my roland jc120. 
as the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. if you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. i purchased it for that reason...and i'm an adult, so i can be careful. this bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. i would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. it will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.there are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason i gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price. 
i got this for my boss loop station, but it doesn't work very well. i keep hoping i'll find something it does work well with... 
that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. i bought the .90 gauge at guitar center and love them. these were made for that dave mustain muted crunch sound. i don't know if i will use these forever but for right now i love them. just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.dunlop ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.buy em!!!! 
long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. so when my strings wear out, i got this. now i feel like playing an emg bridge on my f/archtop's neck position, without the power that an emg pickup has to offer. yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like seagulls...bottom line, i recommhis string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. if you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string. 
i've been playing guitar for over 40 years, and these tortex picks are nearly the worst i'v ever used. they are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity-clack noise. dunlop ultex picks sound much better. 
i can't hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them. better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast 
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase. 
to a great brand like dunlop. let's hope this is just a short-term fluke. 
it's simple, basic, but i don't think it does that good of a job. this is because it doesn't really humidify that much and doesn't extery far into the guitar. 
this product is not what it seems. it has a cool name, but that's about it. it's a tool oil that stinks. i tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. after doing away with the fast-fret, my playing has improved and i hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. i now use old english and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. you will too... 
not a great mic, but if you need something realitively cheap, it'll do. limited dynamic range. but, it works. wish i'd have gotten something a little nicer though. 
it just randomly pops off my bass, it's so slick that when you let go it the neck just goes straight down. i hate it. 
years ago i used the clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. i couldn't tell from the picture, that these were full size, and i didn't check the size in the description. i still had a few of the small ones, so i used them as templates, to cut these down. i would have rated them higher, if i could have used them as is. it's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. i purchased two six packs of clayton teardrop picks, but found dunlop 423r60 0.60mm (orange) tortex small tear drop guitar picks, 36-pack which are a lot cheaper. 
this is a basic eq pedal, that is a bit noisy in my testing. even when running on battery power, there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs. 
i don't like the feel or sound of these strings. i bought both the 10 and the 11 and they both hurt my fingers and sound like tin foil. i would not buy these again 
it is not the size for mini guitar. may be for the big one...connections are shaky. you will surely notice that the quality is toooo low. 
total flimsy junk. it leans wayyy too far back. i'll be damned if i put my $1000 guitars on these things. on the other hand, chromacast makes one that's very close to this price, and i doubt that it could have been more for the money i paid.in summary... do not BUY this piece of junk. 
...for something, but not a guitar. wasn't sure what to do with it so i now use it to mount a large cookbook, or notepad computer, so i can follow a recipe. it seems to work okay for that. just don't use this for guitars. an electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far, and the arms have no grip. this thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project. it may even give you aids! but probably not. however, animals could have been harmed in the making. but most likely, and in reality, it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner. 
not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder. thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par. you'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips. 
the wire clipper and winder work o.k., but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn't slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out. bad design by someone who doesn't use it to pull pins out of a bridge. i p using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out. i've done it successfully for years. 
header says it all. works well enough as a string winder, but i was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me, this did not work well at all. went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle. 
i honestly really didn't find this thing useful at all. first, the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesn't open easily (very stiff action), so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick. and as for the winder... i suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. but it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything i used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help. didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing. just looked at it... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.each time i have set out to use it, i p turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string. i just recently  up buying a set of crescent brand miniature cutters & needle-nose pliers set(the pliers are just the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding). when i have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar, i'll try the notch bridge peg puller. but other wise, this thing gets a serious two-star &#34;meh&#34;. 
i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recomm at the music store. put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic 12 string. have 2 problems with the strings. first, the bass e (11th string) broke while tuning it up. had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not elixir). i have changed strings many, many times, so i am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the e string itself. second, the high D (8th string) seems \"dead\"; it does not \"ring\" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets i've used). considering these strings cost much more than others, i certainly am disappointed in them. hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good. 
i bought a set as they were recomm to get the tone i was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. installed as usual and tuned them. they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. my capo could not even hold them. i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. when i looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. i released the tension on all the strings as fast as i could and left it. i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. use at your own risk!!!!!!! i personally wouldn't give a nickel for them. 
not two weeks after i put these on the a string broke close to the ball on the string. i break high e strings on occasion. but something as thick as an a string?? maybe it was a defective string as i thankfully bought two sets and i was able to pull the a out of the other set and it has been fine since. now however i have the dilemma of should i just buy more strings and just use the second set as i need them. further more do i stick with the same brand. that is supposed to last longer than average strings. at this point i am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there. i will update once i decide if i should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky'supdate 3/25well another month went by(a week ago) and the d string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe i either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be. either way its losing another star. if it happens with a different set of strings i will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly 
i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic, which i was pretty happy with. for my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn't have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings. i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and i was right. i put a pair of d'addario xl 9.5 (highly recomm for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings. i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently. don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of d'addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings. 
looked like the chrome was cheesey and they  up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position 
did not hold the strings down very well for me... i love the feel of it, but the spring needs more power. 
this is an update to my original review because i have now fully tested two of these capos. i'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here. i'm not sure how it's possible. i've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim dunlop capos. i had purchased two, which i have now given away to student players as i cannot use them. i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar. the e string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. both capos had this very same problem.when i received these capos, i noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual jim dunlop capos. the craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official jim dunlop capos. the rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product. as a professional musician, i need to purchase reputable brand-name products because i can't afford to have my gear failing during performances. i have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation. when i contacted the seller, they were not honest with me. 
i know many people love the design, but i find it much too frustrating. you have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly, then snap it in, then turn and turn the screw, oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw. then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again. what a farce. this is the worst capo i've owned, and i've tried nearly every brand and type. yeah, i've had people show me how to do it right, and i know to do it right. it's just wrong to have to spo much time slipping it on, snapping it, screwing it in, screwing it off, having it fall off, forget it, it's garbage to me. also, while i'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day, the last thing i want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw. it's actually slightly painful to the fingers (momentarily, but why have to deal with that??) to work with. this design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it. the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable.no thanks. 
i bought this hoping to use as int, angled into guitar & straight into mixer, wrong, have to use it the other way around ... sad! 
only lasted 2yr. i have a lot of cheaper cables that get more use/abuse than this one that have outlasted it. 
could not get to fit small sound hole. once in sound hole pickup did not work at all. would not buy it. 
i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. one was in the skb f case ($99.95 on amazon), the other in this gator case purchased locally. i was told it was just as good as the f case. both  up in checked luggage. after 1 flight from florida to lax and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up. the padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case. neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, i just ordered another skb f case. the gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips. the skb fs will be my airline cases from now on. 
i don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school. when you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.it'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. i just don't like the features of this stand at all. 
i've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting. this one is the worst. the plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle. bad...just bad.secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp. it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement. after twisting on it twice i stripped it out. now the thing is worthless. i'm returning it asap.i would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing. do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6\" pop filter. if you don't, you'll wish you did. 
not happy with the sellers description or the product. the description says \"heavy duty\" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic mic clip, but it's not. it's rubber!!! it sucks. used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and i can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. it's flexible!!! who uses flexible mic clips?!!! make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead. 
its poorly made with attention to detail. i ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at amazon. but they will not screw down all the way and are losse. it is useless!!! other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine. 
just assembly for a try, only few rolls with music, it's had some hole on head, that's mean bad quality. buyer beware for this kind of. 
not so pleased with the sound quality..sorta disappointed with it over all...but ya get what ya pay for ....so i'll keep it anyway 
crap these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bunless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of ernies i didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again 
i've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. mainly due to the low cost. they work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. the guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go \"flat\" sounding. these are not quality strings at all, just cheap chinese made quality. they are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. better strings are worth the extra cost. you actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. i've had this problem with all the d'addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. the tarnish and corrosion often up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster. 
i have played on d'addario before, actually the first string i started out on.super light's are ok, but can wear out real fast, so, it's importent not to put to much stess on them.....espescially if you do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme b, etc they will break. any skilled guitarist know's to use extream caution when tuning....any strings,i did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them) i would not recamhese for beginer's, cause beginer's to press hard, when they first stat out.personally, i don't like d'addario's at all, i find the tone to bright. 
far too slippery for my fingers when i shredding and the tip wears out way too fast as well. 
this piece of plastic is just terrible. you'd be better off with a couple of books and a towel.not recomm! 
go build your own. build it to your specs and have a solid stand. if not, you can find a lot better head stands. this one was a huge disappointment. does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick. im back with my wood block and am happy. 
i might have done something wrong...i read in a review that these hold six picks.it held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart...i'll just keep using my pockets. 
man, this thing would not even hold my normal sized picks! do not BUY - it is a wast of money... ug! 
i use clayton 1.26mm picks, a heavy pick but certainly not oversized. my picks don't fit!!! if i shove them in, i can't get them out. also, this thing is huge for the back of the neck. 
my picks fall out way too easy while i'm playing live 
dont last but a couple weeks..terrible feed back as the near the plugs detirorate quickly. will never buy again even if only 5 bucks 
second one i bought. lousy build quality and only lasted 3 months. went through two of these before i learned my lesson. don't waste your money on this junk. i love planet waves stuff normally, but these are junk. 
i got a couple of these....only buy this cable if there is no CHANCE that it will be ever used in the real world....after only a month mine has developed a nasty short in the plug....and of course , since this cord is molded/sealed up tight , it can't be repaired.......you could cut off the plug and solder a good 1/4 inch plug on it...but why bother.?....just save your headaches and money and buy a good heavy duty cord....this cord is too flimsy......its junk with a fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug housing...but inside its junk....thrown away money.!!!.......buy a lottery scratch off instead,,, 
this was bought based on the advice of others. i had a cable with the standard neutrik/switchcraft-type fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.it worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. it happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that i swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. after confirming the guitar was okay, i tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.d'addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. you also have to get r.a. taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. the extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. in my case, i bit the bullet and did what i should have done the first go-round and got a really nice dimarzio cable.again, this cable sounds good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. the good news is that imo high price is not a guarantee of any cable sounding good. the replacement dimarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. i don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but i want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. this one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.so the replacement that planet waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. i figure i'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. if i have a few $ for the shipping and d'addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, i may get it replaced. more likely i will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - imo it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.if this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, i'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. and if d'addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. idk how much r&d; it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what i would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. that would not make it a deal breaker. 
well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks. bought a new f mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago. last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. messed around a bit and it started to work. today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp. thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy. got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either. at least my new amp is working and i only have to replace a $12 cord.maybe i'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if i bought it at a local store i'd return it. not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund. will just move on to another company's cord. 
the cable died on me in less than a month. very disappointed in built quality. 
these look so neat that my brother and i both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last christmas. unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play. 
i purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. i was disapointed when i mounted a shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. these are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. they may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. it would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. i wasted my money. don't waste yours. perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-) 
nice looking gooseneck, threads are clean, fits well. however, the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic (shure sm58) without collapsing. better try another brand, or sp buck or two more to get a better product. 
this arrived and when i tried to use it, it turned out that the male threads were some oddball metric size that does not fit any standard adapter.instead, these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip, so now i have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck and a clip.this is such a standard item, that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads, and no excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths... 
i have several mxr pedals. every one is superb--except for this phase 90 (the non- review ed here). this phase 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. i did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (look up \"mxr phase 90 mods,\" and \"erik's corner\" will show you how.) i made the \"r28,\" \"c11,\" and \"c12\" modifications. the result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. finally, i tried adjusting the internal trim pot. on no setting could i get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. i spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. no luck. bottom line: if you want a phaser that doesn't add significant distortion, avoid this incarnation of the phase 90. 
okay, color coding is a great idea.divas will not use the red ball windscreen.why?because, from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose.no kidding! i have had several tell this to me and my sound tech. so save your dough, buy any color but red.diva's!!!! what can i say? 
i bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a gls mic and it doesn't fit either. a little too small. 
yes you can tweak it so its less, but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable. 
do not use these to polish your guitar. it leaves tons of small fibers all over, and is hard to clean up. a total disaster. these are good for maybe wiping up dog poop, but not cleaning anything. 
not very substantial. it began to tear on my guitar strings. i was hoping for something that would hold up to more uses. 
this pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like crazy! you will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit.i'm not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either- there are a lot of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable.over all i would not recommhis product. 
compression/sustain wise, this unit is decent but i cannot abide the noise ... i tolerated it for a while but wound up pulling it for a cleaner compressor ... 
if you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a guitar > volume pedal > amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a poorly engineered pedal. it can't be review .)it does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (not \"true bypass\" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal. i will need to try that out, but it does not excuse ernie ball from their responsibility. major fail on their part.2 stars is generous because eb fails to honor the simple \"first do no harm\" principle. it harms your tone. how dumb is that? the pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though i have my doubts about their \"string\" mechanism over time. the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.i have no recommions for a volume pedal. because of the feel, and esthetics, i do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver. 
if you are looking for a 100% leather mandolin strap, consider another strap. the outside surface of the planet waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man-made material glued to the thin leather part. i will be ordering the levys \"leather mandolin strap (walnut)\". 
i started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked, but when i tried to add a second/third stomp box, i couldn't get any guitar sound only a loud buzz. i returned this product i did further testing, i would not recommt to anyone. with my personal experience in mind, i would advise you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply. hope this helps 
i bought this to replace a cord i was using to practice my guitar. my first cheap cord wasn't actually broken, but i didn't want any down time, so i had this just sitting there as a replacement. fast forward some time, and i just wanted to try it out. even though my cheap cord was still working fine, i really wanted to just try out the new cord.i really wish i had done that in the first 30 days. this cord did not work right at all. it seems like there is a short in it somewhere. i had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place. of course since it is for guitar, it falls almost immediately out of place again. so, i am back to the cheap cord that hasn't failed, unlike this brand new bad cable. 
through my ampeg bass amp, the low E string gets distorted when you push the bass control above 7, and the upper 3 strings sound kind of plain. 
my guitar originally came with d'addrio exp and they sounded good. i replaced them with elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. this time i got a 3 pack of ej16-3d light. the were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.but the sound is the problem. it's terrible. they sound very muddy. crisp tone distinction is just not there. i thought light would be the better route, but now i'm not sure. i purchased some others to try. also, since a purchased a 3 pack. i may just change the strings completely again to see if i just have some dead strings. 
bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand. mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges. the strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks i didn't like. tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes. g-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\\ 
the small e-string and the g- string both broke on the ball hile tuning. i haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball uckily i bought the three pack.but i can't recommhis product. 
d'addario,what's up? these didn't last long at all.i don't play my martin very often,(too busy with electrics..) but these were trashed in a month.guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now? never purchase again. 
this is a beautiful shock mount. however for the price it didnt perform. the mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on p's and s's. not worth the price. 
i was not happy with the sound of these strings. the ead steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon gbe strings sound tinny. for an extra $2 i bought the d'addario ej45 pro arte and got a much, much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old yamaha g-60. sphe extra $2 its well worth it. 
i tried the dean markley blue steel light accoustic strings on my takamine guitar, and will soon replace them. on quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar. string did not break as i rather expected, but it looks bad. on sound, these seemed okay at first, but i still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and e steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me. and i find the low E wound string notes to be too high as i move up the neck, more so than other sets i have used.guess i'll go back to d'addario and ernie ball. 
if you expect to get what you pay for, prepare to be disappointed. sounds weak. sounds old. sounds worn. sounds dull. i wanted to experience a new brand on my stratocaster. i can afford to pay twice as much. but i am going to keep using my d'adario strings from now on. i am so disappointed. these strings are for the &#34;campfire guitarist&#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling, tapping, pull offs, or sweepers. if you are a tone fanatic keep looking. if your guitar deserves the best, do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. respect your guitar. i wouldn't be surprised if they are made from china.
