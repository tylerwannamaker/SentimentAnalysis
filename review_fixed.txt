name Jake review the product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.i did not realized it was double screened until it arrived, so it was even better than i had expected.as an added bonus, one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy i used to buy, so for reminiscent's sake, i cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording. :dif you needed a pop filter, this will work just as well as the expensive ones, and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!buy this product! :]  overallrating 5 lineend
name Rick review the primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies. the double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. the metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. the goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it.  overallrating 5 lineend
name RustyBill review nice windscreen protects my mxl mic and prevents pops. only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Sean review this pop filter is great. it looks and performs like a studio filter. if you're recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Mike review monster makes a wide array of cables, including some that are very high end. i initially purchased a pair ofmonster rock instrument cable - 21 feet - angled to straight 1/4-inch plugto use with my keyboards, but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar i thought i'd pinch a few pennies. i am so glad i did.i compared this cable model to the more expensive models i previously purchased and, aside from looks, could not detect any difference in sound. i swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards, ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference.What the more expensive model has going for it is looks. i am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision. you may find, as i did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Wilhelmina review i bought this to use with my keyboard. i wasn't really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. it doesn't work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano, which is what i'd always used. doesn't have the same feel either. nowhere close.in my opinion, a sustain pedal like the m-audio sp-2 sustain pedal with piano style action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. the price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. the only thing i've found the yamaha fc-5 sustain pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where i keep my electric guitar pedals.  overallrating 2 lineend
name C.E. review this fender cable is the perfect length for me! sometimes i find it a bit too long but i don't mind. the build quality is great and i know that it will last. the only gripe i have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily, requiring me to tighten it often.sound quality is not affected, and the color is cool, definitely try this cable out.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Charlo review i've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well. for years i used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend. when they finally gave out, i got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at guitar center- really more of an impulse buy than something i put any thought into. after the third or fourth guitar center cable failed from light use i decided to try these cables. not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better. i am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as i move around and the cheaper ones eventually fail mid-cable. i don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable. this cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well. these are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables. there is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but i haven't needed it. five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input. do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab. you want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.edit- more than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues. the price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from hosa, monster or planet waves-  overallrating 5 lineend

name MetalFan review this is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. i bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. one thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. you'll be able to hear them rattle. it seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber, but other than that, the cable looks cool and works well.i also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. i bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. it's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. the green cable is good for that.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Ann review when i was searching for midi cables for my art x-15 foot controller, i came across these hosa ones, and they were $2 dollars each! as they are now $6, i realize i would still be happy with that price as well, as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors, and work flawlessly. you must realize that they are only 5 feet, as i overestimated it and now wish they were longer. for any connection from racked sound modules, this will be perfect.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Mark review hosa cable quality can be all over the place, some of their products are good (sound good, reliable, long lasting) and some of their products are not good (affect sound negatively, break prematurely, short useful life span).these guitar cords are actually quite nice, they feel good (gooey soft rubber jacket like mogami), they sound good and so far they are working reliably, the rubber jacket is about .25&#34; in diameter (by eye) and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug.i bought these when i needed cables fast for an internet concert, we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up. these cables arrived in good working condition and we've been using them continuously since.we have over a dozen tube amps and are very particular about sound degradation but so far these cables have not disappointed anyone.i would buy more if i needed them.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Michael review i never really considered a cheaper cable, i was always taught to get the best i could afford. when this showed up in a cable search on amazon, i jumped on it. i figured i had nothing to lose.to my surprise, this is an excellent cable, with good build quality and a strong, thick jacket that inspires confidence. the sound through it is identical to my monster cables, and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm, guess i should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. i will never do that again.this is worth the money twice over, try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!  overallrating 5 lineend
name M. review for the price, fantastic.they do feel light and i don't trust the build quality at the key stress points (where cable meets connector), but then again i am not going to push it.set your guitar down on it by accident when it's plugged in and...who knows.but for seven bucks it gets the job done. recommended if you are doing the \"beginner\" thing and testing the waters.otherwise, spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Quaestor review this cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. it's quality outweighs its price. let's face it, a cable is a cable is a cable. but the quality of these cables can vary greatly. i replaced a lighter cable with this one and i was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. i have an ibanez art series guitar into an ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. with nothing changed but the cable, there was a significant difference in quality and volume. so much so that i checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. the quality appears good. the ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum i had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. i've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.hosa gtr210 guitar cable 10 ft  overallrating 5 lineend

name S. review i bought this for my canon vixia hf g10 video camera and a shotgun mic that i recently purchased for it. i needed a 12&#34; wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic (which is mounted on the mini advanced shoe) to the microphone plug on the video camera...the wire on this thing is not 1 foot long. the actual wire is under 8&#34; long itself. i would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle... i'd have rated it 1 star, but i tried it on my nikon d3200 (shoe mounted shotgun mike) and it worked out ok. still a tight fit though (since there's only 8&#34; of wire)...i'd recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2' adapter; worst case scenario, you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesn't fit.also, not sure if it's the wire (so this didn't affect stars) but i hear a hiss when recording. again; unsure if it's the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the dslr or not (or my shotgun mic).  overallrating 2 lineend
name tada review well made, xlr 3 pin adaptor to mini. needed to get a real XLR mic into the computer and this did the job.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Jason review the listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo xlr is. stereo xlr is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones, where left and right are separate unbalanced wires. this cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced trs cable. this item is not a mono balanced xlr to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.a little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire. pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Mike review first, the reasons why i awarded this five stars: the construction is uniformly excellent. both ends have strain reliefs, the 1/8\" connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which i insert it, and the xlr end is a quality component.i purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in mypowerwerks 50 watt personal p.a. systeminto something more useable. this greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable pa by allowing me to plug in another mic. since i have three of those units daisychained i was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter.another reason why i love this is it's noise free. in some environments in which i play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit. i have not had that problem with this one, so it's another plus.overall i am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case i damage or lose my primary one. it's a bit pricier than others i considered, but i feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Rexomus review i use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom h1. this adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events. i own several of these and love them.i highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional. also check out hosa's sinlge xlr to double xlr splitter.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Rob review this adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small dv cameras will function but with caveats.first, it's construction is pretty light weight. that means you will have to be \"gentle\" with it when using it. that's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.second, the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. this is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. that means you would need another short xlr mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.so just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. i went to sam ash music and found a similar adapter cable, heavy duty, and with a longer cable for the same price. it pays to shop around!  overallrating 4 lineend
name TriggerHappy review well made. works as it should. however, seem to be getting a little bit of noise from a shotgun mic straight into a d800. (more than the usual expected)to see if it was the mic, cable, or adapter; tested it going straight into a zoom h4 recorder.seems to be a little but more noise going through this adapter cable than straight into the xlr input.no big surprises. minor clean up in post.  overallrating 4 lineend

name David review ers wondering if such an economical cable could be any good, but i trusted their judgment and gave these a try and so count me in among those who weren't sure but have become convinced that hosa knows how to make a great cable, and to do so without the need to charge monster prices.  overallrating 5 lineend
name HMMWV review on my mixer, i have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire trs with send on the tip, return on the ring, and a common ground. but my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4\" tr ins and outs.this is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkbehringer shark fbq100 automatic feedback destroyerto the 1202-vlz3's send/returnsmackie 1202-vlz3 12-ch. compact recording/sr mixeri probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Lee review i still operate in an analog environment quite often, so i end up using lots of inserts. i have 8 channels of compression, limiter, gate and expander, plus various eqs and effects processors that need to be routed and applied to specific channels. i have an insert snake that i use as well, but the individual insert cables (of differing lengths) that i carry are lifesavers that make me a more efficient soundman during setup and a more flexible soundman during the show!  overallrating 5 lineend

name N. review when you need an audio insert cable, you need an audio insert cable.we custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations. for mobile rigs, such as mixer cases with processing gear, it's simply not cost effective, and hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability. there are other brands, but our reputation is at stake.hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation, while lowering our labor costs. thanks for such a dependable product, hosa! thanks for such a great price, amazon!  overallrating 5 lineend
name Cooper review i play my i-pod through a small guitar amp. great way to wake up the kids. works perfectly for the purpose. keep in mind small end for i-pod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono. if needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Astraeus review these little patch cables work nicely, there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..i'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. the product description says 6 inches, right? if you jump over to these link removed planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches, right?) the hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches, whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. i only used the hosa cable as an emergency back up.to conclude, would i recommend these? yes, if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable, go for these. but my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Andytoy review i bought 6 of these xlr to 1/4&#34; adapters hoping to connect my microphones to an old funky mixer i owned with 1/4&#34; inputs. it didn't end up working because i discovered i needed to convert the microphone level to line level (which these don't do), however they do convert xlr to 1/4&#34; balanced quite well. just not what i needed in my particular situation.  overallrating 4 lineend
name D. review i use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my xlr cable snake, to change 1 channel into my monitor return. i plug an xlr to female 1/4\" stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. now i can record with 6 channels, and monitor with 2. (it's an 8 channel xlr snake). why do i go through all that you ask? because i have an 8 channel xlr snake, and instead of buying another snake, why not ADAPT the snake i have? hence the word adapter... :-p i love it. it's a great tool to add versatility to your setup, no matter what you're doing. definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an xlr to balanced 1/4\" stereo... it's high quality, and very solid, i definately expect this to last me a long time.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Andytoy review i bought this xlr splitter to split the lead vocal from foh to my monitor rack. used this way it worked great and i never had any problems with signal loss or power issues. i began using a transformer isolated xlr splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter. my only issue with the hosa y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short, so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when i plugged it into our lead singer's microphone. it would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground, or horizontally placed, but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Rexomus review this dual splitter works perfect. i own a live event video company and i shoot a lot of weddings. the most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. i always say, half of video is audio. for years i used to run a line directly out of the dj's mixer to get my audio. the issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. often though, the signal is to hot, the music is crap, or the dj says something stupid. with just the dj's voice i can edit the way i want and compress time. this product has improved my productions beyond it's price sold. i use them to run a separate clean audio line from a dj's wireless systems to my own audio recorder. they work perfectly and haven't failed me once.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Bassman review this was recommended to me by the top engineer at genz-benz bass amplification company. andy said that this product is far superior to any other. he was right. fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my shuttle 6 amp. also fixed the effects loop jacks, which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs. not good! after several gigs worth of testing, both problems are resolved! andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating, cleaning and coating effect on the components. wow! and no, andy does not own stock in, have affiliation with, or represent in any way the manufacturers of de-oxit. nor do i.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Samuel review as a freelancer, i occasionally work with a band that plays the midwest, performing on a near-weekly basis. these are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet. it's all about money to them. i couldn't believe it when i first saw the group using these nady mics (even lower-priced several years ago) and insisting they were as good as shure sm-57's and 58's. i still don't believe the quality of workmanship compares (any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much). but these nady's handle the announcing, the vocals, and, when needed, the softer sounding instruments (flute, harmonica), and none has broken or quit on my watch.i'm a keyboardist, so mic power and fidelity don't affect me. i'm only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important \"gear component.\" at the same time, my embarrassment, i confess, is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee. after all, who's playing--and getting paid for it?  overallrating 4 lineend
name Shastastan review we bought this mic after seeing how our grandson was handling the mic that came with the karaoke machine thinking that mic would not last very long. i hope it does because this nady sp-4c is a very impressive mic for the price. we our using it with our roland cm30 cube and plan to use it with a roland micro cube also. i would have given it 5 stars if the cord connection to the mic was not a little loose.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Andytoy review i bought this cable for my band's live show setup. i bought it almost a year ago and still currently use it for the same application. while not the best quality cable, the length and price make it a good value for the money, especially if you're buying several at a time. i don't use these cables in the studio but for live, they're fine. i'd recommend this cable if you're on a budget and looking to buy several at a time. if you're only going to buy one, i'd look into canare or mogami, they're a little bit more expensive but easy to get and worth the price.  overallrating 4 lineend

name H. review i bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. it works for that. it's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables, and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. i tend to use it for cable runs where i don't expect a lot of movement (e.g., running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.the jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell, and it really activated my allergies at first. i stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. not everyone has allergies, so this might not be an issue for all folks--but i couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.they're cheap and they work fine. i haven't noticed any sound issues at all.  overallrating 4 lineend
name karaoke review i've had this cable for awhile and i'm not too impressed with the quality. the plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin. i use it at home on a practice mic and it hasn't had much of a workout. i don't think it would hold up long on stage at a venue.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Phaeton review 4 stars instead of 5 only because this thing won't tune your guitar or carry your amp. i use this solo, in a duo with a bass player, in a trio with drums and bass. i have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room. i use it through a pyle pro self contained pa into which i also plug my martin grp elec/acoustic. the sound quality is excellent. the volume seems limited only bny what the pyle pro will put out. i would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and pa. i haven't heard a hint of feedback and the on/off switch is a plus.the 36.99 price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to. i bought a 32&#34; toshiba flat screen for around 230 bucks, think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less. the same is true of a lot of audio gear. a lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but it's great to have a company like shure make something so good and so affordable. they have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford. i cannot recommend it strongly enough.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Applewhite review it is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isn't a shure sm58. this is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the sm58 than its sound. i have a couple of sm58s and a couple of pg58s. i was considering the sm48, but the pg58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.the first thing i noticed out of the box was that the pg58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. it also has a different switch than the sm58. the metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. i then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. i tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then i changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the eq on the pa. i repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.here's what i noticed: the sm58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. the pg58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. they are about equal on volume. the slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an eq or just ordinary tone controls. neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.i haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. it's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but i have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the pg58, but that could be just the settings.i looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. the sm58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10k hz, and it picks up a few db before the pg 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 hz. however, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the sm58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.i also tried out two different behringer mikes and a radio shack mike. the behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. i tried out a behringer 2000xm and was impressed by the similarity. these mikes sound almost identical (the b 2000 and the shure sm). the behringer 2000xm seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800xm, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.i then plugged in a radio shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. the model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. this was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.i didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but i did reach some conclusions:there is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the shure sm58 held up as some unreachable standard. they are sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. however, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the shure pg58, and most likely the sm48, though i didn't have any of those to test.i wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. i'm giving this 4 stars only because i haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the sm58.  overallrating 4 lineend
name David review this microphone is great for singing with a pa and an electric guitar. i sing worship/praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely. i don't think it is the same as an sm58 but it is exactly what i need. built to last and it is a shure.  overallrating 5 lineend

name karaoke review i bought this one to replace a shure 8900. it's a big step up from that one. i am pleased with it. the old one had a lot of handling noise. this one has a little but it is very good for the money i paid for it. my next one will be an sm58, but that will be awhile from now. i'm very happy with this pg58.update:december 2012the handling noise is definitely something to consider. it would keep me from buying another one of these. other mics i own don't have this problem to this degree.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Samuel review i started with the shure pg58 and most recently acquired the shure sm58. i'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a neumann or telefunken mic costing 5 g's simply isn't that much better than a nady mic costing 10 bucks. but with respect to the shure, i'm less sure that the sm58 isn't worth 40% more than the pg58. perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and \"clean\" amplifier and have tweaked the eq settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another. it was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency p.a. that led me to realize the pg58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the sm58. switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain i needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).p.s. i notice that the head of the pg58 is larger than that of the sm58. since the rise of the \"digital audio workstation\" (who doesn't have a computer with free, included garage band on it?), large, even gold-plated, expensive-looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place. despite appearances, when it comes to mics, size doesn't matter--except for appearances (directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half-way around the face, knowing that the girls in the front-line think they're cool--they look just like madonna'a or janet's headgear). some of the best mics are tiny, with an opening the size of a pin-hole.  overallrating 4 lineend

name David review although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and i've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when i bought my first one which was then known as a \"shure model 545 unidyne iii.\" that mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and i was still using it when i needed one with an on/off switch function. i've owned or used countless modern day sm-58's and sm-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers. i have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and i don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a sm-57. to me the sm-57 sounds similar to the $469 shure sm-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away. i'd only use an sm-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive. by design the sm-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the sm-57's. i prefer the sm-57's over the sm-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end. the sm-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled. the sm-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic i've ever used. if you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the sm-58. if you are ever going to use an sm-57 for vocals i'd recommend buying the shure a2ws windscreen with it. that genuine shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the sm-57. the sm-57 will pop like mad without one. the only possible drawback to the sm57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days. i can't find a modern sm-57 with a switch anywhere. however, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. for my money, the sm-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes. for studio vocals i'd use an sm-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the sm-57 when the built-in variable eq on the sm-7 is set the way i like. the sm-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable. you can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen.  overallrating 5 lineend
name J review good all around mike. if you are looking for a solid mike to start your studio, i recommend this one. best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals. best mike for the price and purpose.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Jorge review seriously? the shure sm57 sets the standard, which by all other instrument microphones are judged.no kidding. they work great with guitar (for a real acoustic guitar sound, drums, congas, tablas... you name it.. if it's an instrument the sm57 delivers.i hear it's good for vocals as well. when the president gives a speech, the sm57 is there.in my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the sm57. the sm58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).for instrument sound reinforcement... bar-none... the best.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Joshua review if it's good enough to track tom petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums, its good enough for the rest of us. sounds great on amps and perc. dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. my drummer still uses it on his kit and i never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) it's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: ie presentor, pg seies, digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. this is the last of the cool from shure.  overallrating 5 lineend
name J. review there's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't, it should). this is a great all purpose dynamic mic, i use it for instruments, vocals, even field recording sometimes. the sm58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals, but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice. they're pretty much the same mic as far as i'm concerned, and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner i think you'll find the same thing. and if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably, then you probably already know what you're looking for. i'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon, but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics, you can't go wrong here.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Lee review i use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets. it works as well as most mics and is more durable than most. i have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine. as long as i run sound for a living i will keep some of these mics.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Rob review considering that the sm57 was introduced to the world in 1967, a year after the shure sm58lc shure sm58 vocal microphone, i guess the 58 gets batman status, relegating the 57 to that of robin. but that's not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time, and except for the 58's acoustic foam lined cage pop screen, the two mics are identical electrically.the sm (studio microphone) 57 was designed to begin it's life in a recording studio, as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers, drum kits, etc. in that capacity, it had no use for the pop screen of it's cousin the sm58, still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day. so the sm57 slimmed down and even though it's still a fine vocal mic, you'll see it used mostly mic'ing instruments, which it excels at.one of it's long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the white house. a pair of sm57's is always seen on various white house podiums for press conferences and there is even a vip bundled kitshure sm57 vip dual microphone kityou can buy for this exact type of use.the sm57 is an extremely rugged mic, built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse. that's one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies. and on top of that, it's just a great sounding mic for the price.there is a performer seriesshure beta 57a microphonethat looks very similar to the sm57 but the beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different. so make sure you try before you buy.bottom line is the shure sm57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced. a best value for sound companies, home studio recordists and touring musicians.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Daits review it is not a bad mic for the price ( if you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks) but it is no comparison to a studio mic since i have worked in a recording studio. now, you need to decide what you want, getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for; it is like having hd tv and bd player but playing an ordinary cd. you would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer, speakers and so on. if you are a home or hobby user, then go for this mic. this mic is quite good for its price. i would probably say, it exceeds your expectations.arrived as promised in a frustration free packing. also, make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit.the only reason i did not give 5 stars is , mine had a little dent on the body ( may be due to transportation) but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks.  overallrating 4 lineend

name David review the first rule of microphones is that, \"no one microphone is perfect for every purpose.\" rule two is, \"experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound.\" i've used shure sm58's along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968. i primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but i have used (and still do use) them for singing some back up vocals.the sm58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use. some people, me included, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic, the shure sm-57. the sm-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice. for example, anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the sm-58. people with softer or weaker voices will want the sm-58.the sm-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means the bass increases the closer you get.) this mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away. the reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don't sound right. on the other hand, the sm-57 sounds best several inches away from the user's mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away. while the sm-58 is certainly the number one professional pa vocal mic, there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly. it works ok for conga drums and the like, but the sm-58 is about the last thing you'd want to use to mic a sax or guitar. personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice, but for some people they sound great. the live vocal mic that works best for me is the shure sm-57 with a windscreen. however for other people the sm-58 works better. it depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do. if you have a very deep voice, the sm-58 might be the second best choice after the sm-57 which has a better low frequency response.one certain advantage of the sm-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability. this mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying pa squeal. another advantage of the sm-58 is that it is still available (at a slight extra cost) with a built-in on/off switch. the sm-58's ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars. i've seen sm-58's dented, rusty, dusty, smoked up, spit into, with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet i've never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it.all the pro-line shure mics are top quality. the pro line shures also hold their value well. if you buy one and decide you don't like it, you can get about what you paid for it on ebay. i would compare as many mics as possible before buying one. senneheiser's evolution mics sound really good too and are worth a look. the sm-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice. these things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they'd still be around for another 20 years at least.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Humbrecht review great all around mic used for vocals. no frills, tough as nails, and great sound for live music. if you're buying your first mic (or switching from a cheapie) and intend to use it for singing/vocals, this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation. i've never used another one since the first time i switched from a cheaper mic (that came with some bundle) 10 years ago. i depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds i like perfectly. you can stand 3 feet away and really wail, or get up close for some bass response, or anything in between.the sm58-cn comes with the mic, 25-ft cable, cable tie, carry pouch, and mic clip. the standard sm58 does not have a switch (one less thing to break and i don't miss it) but the sm58-s does have it for a few dollars extra.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Rob review in the immortal words that john cameron swayze used when hawking his timex watches during the early days of live television, the shure sm58 vocal mic fits perfectly into that same category.before i found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer, i played in rock bands and did live sound mixing. one of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the sm58. introduced by the shure brothers company in 1966, the sm58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.the mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side. there is a 4k bump in it's frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise. construction is rugged, frequency response is 50 to 15,000 hz, and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.we used to joke about the sm58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn't find one, just grab one of these, they are that tough. i've seen some of these on the road that you couldn't believe still worked, but they did and sounded great.the cage style pop screen gives the sm58 not only it's distinctive look, one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced, but it's part of the functionality. internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam, the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element. as a frame of reference, theshure sm57lc shure sm57 cardioid dynamic microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule, but without the pop screen.shure also sells a performer series mic, theshure beta 58a supercardioid dynamic microphonethat looks almost identical to the sm58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buy.the shure sm58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price, they really are a good deal.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Samuel review i made the mistake of thinking i could save forty bucks and get by with the shure pg-58. i'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a p.a.). whatever the reason, the pg-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the roland cube / peavey amps i try to employ it with (i use a 1/4\ review cautioning the consumer to be wary of \"this seller.\" perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to amazon prime, which is the shure sm-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns. but anyone who returns an sm58 probably had no business buying it in the first place. they are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility. in fact, it's the very popularity of the sm58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators. consumers require choice, but with the shure sm58 there need be none.]  overallrating 5 lineend

name HMMWV review everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another. i have a personal preference for the xlr ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters. unfortunately that design isn't used here, but i chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15' of good quality shielded cable with 2 xlr ends (m and f) for well under $1/ft.as for pinout it's straightforward, pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends, while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends. the end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which i haven't had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer's kit because they will be used not if but when the need arises.another favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite xlr ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:gls audio 3ft patch cable cords - xlr male to xlr female black cables - 3' balanced snake cord - 6 pack- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone's oddball source signal. having 6 on hand means you won't quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.back to pyle's product here, i basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire xlrs but gave them a star for value in the product since it's 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot. it's also great when someone yells \"it's too short i need a cable stretcher at the podium!\" and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn't planned for or got moved/quit working. for the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.i finally equipped my cable kit with the usual xlr to rca, 1/4 trs, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the xlr terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards. i used to have 2ea 50 foot xlr cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now i have one left for my kit. with all that i had to build an emergency xlr to 2.5mm ts all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin. even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of \"what if\" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner's daugher's toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.my last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made. it will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you'll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem. people think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position. my only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn't serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted xlr 4 pin stereo y splitter to dual trs female cable i made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry. i chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when i setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Johnny review why drive a pinto when you can drive a cadillac? this is the industries best mic as far as i am concerned. i had a shure sm 58 like everyone else owned but there is no comparison between this mic and a sm58. sm 58 is garbage compared to the beta 58a. spring for the extra bucks and be happy. that's what i always say.  overallrating 5 lineend
name kannibul review i have one of these, as well as several other microphones. the sm58 is a good all around mic - the reason it's an industry standard/go-to, but the beta 58a is a better (in my opinion) vocal-specific mic...basically giving (again, in my opinion) a higher quality sound. the sm58 by comparison sounds muffled/muddy, where the beta58a is clearer, stronger, and more articulate. if you're used to the sm58, then the beta58a can sound thin and harsh, but, that is adjustable at the board - end result is that it's a tighter sounding mic with more clarity.pattern-wise, it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds - i play drums and use this mic for that reason, is that it picks up less of my drums than a sm57 or a sm58.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Lloyd review yes, it costs considerably more than the sm58 and i'm not sure if i could pass a comparison test between the two, but i love this mic! to me, it sounds slightly brighter and clearer than the 58s i have used in the past. if you are a musician who is strapped for cash or trying to make ends meet, get the 58. if you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost, go for the beta. i would buy this again.  overallrating 5 lineend
name meongski review i'm an amateur sound tech. we've been using sm58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we've had before. our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this beta58a because of the good reviews. when i received it i cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah.. for me, it sounded better than sm58. my songleaders have tested it and guess what... they dont want to use the sm58 anymore :)  overallrating 5 lineend
name Nathan review while the shure sm58lc shure sm58 vocal microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals, and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship, the beta 58a needs to be given its due. the beta 58a is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin. that is, the beta 58a, in the confined live scenarios in which i have utilized it, has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues. for vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or, really, any) notes the beta is a dream. this same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or \"popping\" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it.while i wish that i had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon, i can confidently say that the beta 58a is the best vocals microphone that i have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment. quite honestly, i would not be at all surprised if the beta compared well even in confined recording situations. the bottom line is that the beta 58a might be more expensive than its popular cousin, the sm58, but it is worth every penny. anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority. six out of five stars!  overallrating 5 lineend
name Sunn review the beta 58a along with the original sm58 are industry standards, that's well known. as a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there. quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics. in fact, i noticed betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that i played at just recently.i had used the old 58 for years before moving to the beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. the beta is definitetly hotter, with a more sensitive response. your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy, muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. you definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. this is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.\"built like a tank\" is probably a bit overused when describing products but shure's vocal mics truly earn that title. they can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. toss it around, drop it, bury it under other stuff, etc., no problem. when you are maintaining a bunch of music gear, it's nice to have tools that you never worry about. for that reason, i'd highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal. chances are, its in working order no matter what.  overallrating 5 lineend
name almost review i actually replaced a boss tr2 with this pedal. does everything it is supposed to do without the \"perceived\" (that's was they say) volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals. if it's perceived, then how do you explain how good this sounds? i have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because i was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Eric review hey, it gets the job done and that's all i can ask for. i tried several \"cheapo\" pedals, and this one was my favorite of them all. while some had better casings (metal instead of plastic), at the end of the day i'm looking for a good sound, not a pretty pedal board. the pedal seems solid enough, it doesn't take up much space, it sounds great, and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.and, if you are like the typical musician, you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Paul review when i first started setting up my little studio, i wanted something that didn't break the budget. i tried a couple different combo pedal boards, (digitech 500, boss me-70), but quickly realized i wasn't getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up. with not much left, i tried a tuna melt as an example of danelectro. who would think? this thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds, as are most of this line of pedals. i now own about 12-14 of these of all types, and have never been dissapointed save it's very hard to chain them without a lot of noise.then i got into guitar building, and they all got put away. lately, i have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills, and joy of joys! i am rediscovering all these pedals and i absolutely love them.forget the fab series, they are not so hot. buy the old style as the tuna melt, or the big metal ones like the dan echo. you will not be sorry!  overallrating 5 lineend
name S. review hello musicfriends - this is built cheap but sounds great. good controls too. for me in the studio/songwriting its perfect but i would not exactly go on tour with it..... there is something about the knobs i still love, even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it... may be the age thing...  overallrating 4 lineend
name the review it sounds great. nice and warm and lush. one of the better trems i've had the pleasure to use. however, i hate the plastic housing, and how the input/output jacks are located. i don't have heavy feet, so it will probably last a good long while on my board, but i really wouldn't want to put too much weight on it.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Reph review it is exactly what you need in a capo! you can cover all six strings, move one string over to get a drop d tuning or turn the capo upside down to get a partial capo (though a bit of adjusting may be needed to get the strings held down.).all in all, a great capo that is well made and will last forever.kyser is an awesome small christian company and i really like their products and supporting them with my purchases. :]  overallrating 5 lineend

name Donald review i have had one for two years and no complaints, needed another for my travel guitar. the lever arm is coated with a soft plastic sleeve which protects the neck, the spring is firm and in 2 years has not given up any tension. finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple. i take particular caution to make sure that i don't leave it on anything that would indent that material permanently...  overallrating 4 lineend
name Frederick review i've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but i've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this kyser one. it is by far the best i've ever seen and i've been using it for years now and it still works fine. it makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.very highly recommended!  overallrating 5 lineend

name J. review i currenty use two types of capos - the kyser one and shubb capos. both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.the benefits of the kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo i've come across, doesn't require tension adjustment, and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use. the primary benefit of the shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second, it's smaller).the main drawback of the kyser is the lack of adjustable tension. because it's designed to work across the fretboard, it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets, causing frets to wear faster over time. because of this i prefer to use the kyser on my less expensive guitar and the shubbs on the guitar i baby.  overallrating 4 lineend

name LBrandst129 review got what i needed - a basic capo for a good price. the tension is a little tighter than i'd like, but works for me. covers all strings, and depresses them fully. i don't use it often, so i can't speak to its longevity, but good for me!  overallrating 4 lineend
name Leonardo review i've played guitar for 5 years. seen many different capos, but none that quite satisfies me as the kyser.you really can't go wrong with this capo. it is very mobile, easily adjustable, sturdy, and durable.what's good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 string capo and still turn it around to use it asa cut capo. the transparent rubber piece does the same job.it comes in different colors also.i own the black, silver, gold, and camo kyser capos.i also own the cut capo for other styles.i recommend it!all the capos i've had from kyser are still in great conditions.use them all the time at church and at home  overallrating 5 lineend
name Michael review i started using kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since. i now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them. they work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children i teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times. great capos. you won't be disappointed.  overallrating 5 lineend

name ccaptn review i don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo, but this one is quite good. for those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use. it does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built. it is as with all capos, important to take it off when not in use so the \"rubber\" does not get grooved. this is just good common sense. if this lasts a couple of years i will definitely purchase another.  overallrating 4 lineend

name kwb review long time shubb user, but decided to try something different.i think i've found how lazy i am. i ended up using the kyser more often than the shubb because of the fact that you can put the kyser on the peghead.reaching my hand to an always available position on guitars (i.e. the peghead) for the kyser turns out to be much more convenient than reaching to something that is not on the guitar and that could change according to situations, e.g. maybe just by my side on the sofa in my living room, maybe a table or the floor in some other places, for the shubb.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Peter review i have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. the price is right for these, and they work just fine. my only real issue is that sometimes, they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you're going to bar, thus producing a sound you weren't looking for. some of the higher end capo's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. however, like i say, these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard, and are from what i can tell, the most popular model on the market.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Philip review easy to use capo. good strength - holds the strings down well.. not sure that it's as good as the g7th capo, which i still find is the best for holding the strings down evenly so that they stay in tune, but the kyser is much cheaper and does a good job.  overallrating 4 lineend

name snocyclist review i really like my capo, the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic, and it works as it should. however, i feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product. for example, i think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer, and rounded (the back side of a guitar neck is rounded, after all). the spring could definitely be tighter...i do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough. also, the design is fairly nice, but it's mostly aesthetic...it's not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily.don't get me wrong, this is a rather good product, and it's priced about right. it just isn't a high end product/5-star perfect.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Amazon review i bought this pick holder because i hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you can't play with a pick in your strings. i originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock. boy was i wrong. the picture is misleading. this thing is tiny and barely goes across three string. it wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks (maybe more if they are thin) into the wedges on top. stays in place well and is very convenient.Only negative is i don't know how long it will hold up. i think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better. i can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks.  overallrating 4 lineend

name tekHedd review i have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. i think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar, as i often find myself playing with fingers, then suddenly a \"pick song\" starts and... where's a pick? i usually have to offset it, and with the tuner placement i can only fit one pick, but i still find them indispensable. and no tape or other sticky stuff!there is also a model made specially for bass. [updated] i now have the bass model on all of my basses. it is definitely better for thicker strings.the guitar model is now on my gibson explorer. i do love it, but the \"spreading strings\" on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. so, still highly recommended if your headstock has a \"straight through\" design, not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock.

name YetAnotherITGuy review i bought one of these to try on my asher junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick. worked, but it was difficult getting all three picks in one wedgie so i ordered a second one. between the two of them, between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut, works pretty good holding these types of picks (which admittedly, the wedgie was not actually designed for). liked it so much i ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). only down side i see is -- they do seem loose like they could fall out and i doubt the picks will stay in place when i case my guitar (haven't tried it yet). but otherwise, worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around. especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself (real help to me staying organized!).  overallrating 4 lineend
name B. review i've played string instruments for the better part of 55 years... starting with a cheap tijuana wood box as a 5 year old, progressing to martin 6 and 12 string acoustic guitars, and a few electric fender and gibson units.... all good in their own respect.i decided to treat myself to a les paul for my 58th birthday but, not having the financial resources to buy a $3,000 0 git, i shopped and shopped... finally settling on this cherry burst lp-100.it arrived in perfect condition, the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding. it was even \"sorta\" in tune... but a quick dial-in with the electronic tuner brought that right.simply put, nice guitar. after allowing the strings and neck to settle in together, i spent a few hours a week later adjusting string height, intonation, and pick-up distances, and now this lp rocks !!!if you're going to spend mid-range $$$ on a fine practice / performance guitar, you can't go wrong with this one, kids - two thumbs up ![suggestion: a fender mustang 1 or 2 amp makes this guitar sound even better...]  overallrating 5 lineend

name jeff review i have been playing guitar for over 30 years. i've owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime. my wife bought this guitar for me as a gift. i cannot begin to tell you how much i love this guitar. it is a solid, well built guitar. the finish is beautiful. the pictures do it no justice. it sounds incredible. it has great tone and sustain, wonderful harmonics. the clean tones are nice and warm. the neck is fast. no fret noise or hums. the pickups are really nice. its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it. from blues to hard rock & metal. i would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat. you cannot find a better guitar for this price. i would have expected it to cost much more. i am extremely impressed with this great guitar. you can bet, when i add the next guitar to my collection, it will be another epiphone. well done epiphone!!  overallrating 5 lineend
name LA review i had been learning on a squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. after doing research, reading reviews, and checking it out in a guitar store, i chose this one.it's much easier to play than the squier, and it has a better sound. like the squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. i suspect it might need to be adjusted, but i don't have a clue as to how to go about it.it's also a good choice for women. i'm a small woman, and i really like that the neck is smaller. it's also fairly lightweight.overall, i'm happy with my choice. a guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. maybe. i expect to be happy with it for a few years before i upgrade again.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Mano review i bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and i couldn't be happier. this was my first electric and after over a year of owning it, i got a way more expensive fender strat and i still prefer how this epiphone feels; it is really lightweight, a lot more that even other les pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars i have tried, this makes it very easy to play, it stays in tune and it looks really REALLY lovely.i like it so much, that i decided to add a pair of slash's alnico iis on it, that cost more than the guitar itself, this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain, good ol' crunchy-bluessy rock.call me cheap if you want and i wouldn't care, this is one of those items that makes you wonder, how come there's others way more overpriced and just don't find a way to justify that a \"real\" gibson les paul will sound $800 - $1000 better.it wasn't until recently (after 3 years - i estimate somewhere around 1000 hours of heavy use) that it started fretting and that's why i gave it only 4 stars; but what would you expect from a $200 guitar...? i'm sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweet-tone machine it has always been. if you're learning, looking for a first electric or just want a \"practice\" axe that will not dissapoint you, just go ahead and buy it, don't give it a 2nd thought and do it.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Nunya review i have been playing guitar since i was 6 years old (over 3 decades) and i must say this was a very pleasant surprise. i haven't had an electric in years, and didn't have the budget to get a gibson, so picked up this epi les paul 100 instead, along with a fender mustang i amp. great combination. this guitar has a very sloid feel, and came set-up perfectly right out of the box. all it needed was tuning. unlike others, i didn't feel that the strings i got needed to be changed right away, but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them. replaced mine with ernie ball \"not even slinky's\" and couldn't be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds. great sustain, beautiful harmonics, the clean tones are warm, can get nice blues tones out of it, and superb thrash metal too. very versatile. it does not quiet do country or jazz, but it wasn't really meant to.the action is extremely easy, fret board has a great feel to it, good width on the neck, not too slinder but not too thick. it just feels good in your hands.the finish on this product is very nice. one thing though, the pick guard is kind of a tan / cream off white color, not bright white as pictured, but it still looks great.also, not mentioned in the description, but this does come with a 12 foot cord, but it's not the best quality. would recommend picking up a new one when you order.overall, this is well worth the $500 that they list as the msrp. at less than half that its a steal.if you are considering this instrument, don't hesitate.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Skyeye review well, the epiphone les paul came in earlier this morning!am i impressed? u bet cha!this thing is simply beautiful! it arrived well padded in a double box. initially, i spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if i could spot any flaws. none! not a finger print on it anywhere! this guitar is extremely well made and put together right. it was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter. the neck is slim (which is good for my thick hands) and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities. i put a quarter under the 10th. fret and it's right on the &#34;money&#34;!it's considerably heaver than than i thought. i would imagine it weighs about 10-14lbs. i have a strap ordered and on the way.the maple top is a work of art with a superior finish. all the metal hardware appears top quality as are the duncan pickups. this epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing i ever had. your hand floats over the frets!i don't think you could get a better piece for the price point.  overallrating 5 lineend
name SuperGlide review this is one awesome guitar! i also purchased the fender mustang i amp, epiphone custom case (fits like a glove) and planet waves planet lock leather guitar strap (comfortable and very secure) which made for an unbelieveable combination along with rocksmith 2014. i cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination. the only problem in my household is....who gets to play next.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Sweed review waited two months before reviewing my les paul 100 to make sure there were no issues. i am very happy with the guitar. it came well padded and was in excellent shape. it was set up well and has played well out of the box. just did my first string change making sure i used the same gauge of string and didn't have to make any adjustments to the guitar. played as well after the change as it did before. was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and it's a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances. anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play, free prime two day shipping, no sales tax, and saved about $80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store. the savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new mustang 2 v2 amplifier.the only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box. this one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer. it is not a big deal to me but i thought i'd mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone. when i ordered this one i wasn't really sure if a cable would be included or not so i ordered one at the same time, i'm glad i did.  overallrating 5 lineend
name CRS71 review first off, the shipping was fantastic. it shipped the very next day and came very well protected in perfect condition. it is an extremely well made and solid product. i think a few people have given this les paul a rep of just being a \"starter guitar\". trust me when i say, i have no problem leaving my les paul standard at home and taking this one to a gig. it plays well and the sound?? incredible. it even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp. i can't say enough good things about this guitar it's that good. if you're thinking aout buying this guitar, don't. just buy it!! buy it!!  overallrating 5 lineend
name Dakotah review it'd been about 6 years since i've had an electric guitar. i traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. i decided recently after moving back to my home town that i was going to get back into playing electric guitar, only this time i wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. i fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will easily deliver.it came in perfect condition. the action is set perfectly and i don't have any issues with buzzing strings. it comes with clear (black) control knobs, which i'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. but overall this is a great guitar. it even sounds amazing, it really does have that ballsy sound of a lp..... because well 0_o it is a lp. its no Gibson, but it is a lp!very happy with this purchase!!!!  overallrating 5 lineend

name Jeffro review epiphone lp special ii les paul electric guitar, ebonyhello again. i have written a review on this guitar just after i purchased it and now it's been over a year and i still stand by my positive review. i own about 8 guitars now and this guitar is one of two of my favorites. my other favorite is a dean electric 12 string. when i hold and play this epiphone les paul special 2 guitar it feels and sounds like something i could take on stage but it doesn't have the cost associated with a gibson. what's also amazing is that it's still around a $150. it's well worth the noney. it stays in tune and it high quality. well worth the money. i just purchased an electric/acoustic epiphone ukelele today for my chiropractor. i will review that later. if you are looking for a les paul guitar this is not one. not his typical style although amazon does sell one for about $250 so don't let the name fool you. it's still a very nice guitar though. very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners. i highly recommend this guitar. buy it! thank you.  overallrating 5 lineend
name jerkowitz review i've been playing for over 40 years. i currently own 60 or so guitars. my problem with lp's is they feel like a boat anchor around your neck, i've bought and sold quite a few. another problem with real LP's, you only get one chance to drop one, just see how many used ones have head-stock repairs. they are beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play. i deal in used guitars, picked up an epi special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap. i didn't mess with it until i was ready to set it up for resale. i fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars, even a lot of higher end guitars need it. i found on the special ll the frets were actually very well done (chinese version from 2011) and only needed a slight leveling (would have played fine without it but i am very picky). it didn't take much to get it set up, small truss rod adjustment, new set of 10's for strings. little bit of adjustment to the bridge, cut the nut a bit....note it played well the way i got it, just like my stuff perfect. got it set-up and plugged it in to check the electronics and that's when i started to really become impressed with this guitar. cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character, these sounded pretty good, actually very good, nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end. i check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks. it cut through really well. i noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and didn't lose any highs when turned down. the tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep, very nice. i popped off the back cover to check what was in there, full sized pots, maybe not the best quality but much better than expected. i normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way i like but no need to fix what's not broken. yup, i said \"on my personal guitars\" because i am keeping this one for myself. the neck is very fast and comfy, it's not a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me. the tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine, once again if it ain't broke don't fix it. please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut. i've set-up hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work, doesn't matter what price point you are at. this also has a bolt on neck. a lot of players say you have to have a set (glued) neck. i feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit, i prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound, imo. i have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good. i know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking. my advice is to go try one, my taste may not be the same as yours. there are a lot of good value well made guitars now-a-days, i just found at this price vs quality ratio the epiphone special ll really is special. get one, get it set up for a few bucks if you can't do it yourself, and you will have a good instrument. oh did i mention this is a very good looking guitar?  overallrating 5 lineend
name K. review s has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both, and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a monday after a long weekend of partying. for several reasons, if i had this to do over, i would not buy it online (nor would i buy it from gc). better to inspect the actual guitar you'll be buying, and don't be shy about asking them bring out another one if you don't like the first one you see.i discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price, but they would have included a full professional setup, including string change. you are likely to find a similar deal where you live, because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the internet and gc.as it is, i took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup. it had some intonation problem, the action was too high, and as others have commented, the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately. i asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners, as i'd read a lot of people trashing the tuners. bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them, he instead assured me that they were fairly decent, and advised against changing them unless a problem develops.out of the box, i was a little unsure of my purchase. however, now that it's been fully set up and new strings installed, i am quite pleased with this guitar. i don't believe you will find a better guitar, or even close, at this price level.i did a lot of shopping, and considered guitars up to $500 for my first foray into electric. i was tempted to go with something more expensive, on the theory that in a couple years, i'll want to upgrade anyway. now i'm glad i chose this one. for one thing, this is a guitar i'll always enjoy having around. there is nothing cheap or toy-like about it. in 2-3 years, my tastes may change. i may want something completely different down the road, and now i still have that option. had i gone with a more expensive model, i'd feel locked in. no good!BOTTOM line: if you're shopping for a guitar in this price range, i think you'll be pleased with this guitar. buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you're buying, and negotiate to have a setup included, because it will almost certainly need one. have it set up right, install some quality strings, and you'll be very happy with the epiphone lp special ii.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Kev review pretty sweet guitar for the price. sounds like and plays like a les paul. i really like the vintage sunburst color (it's more orange than what the picture shows). the strings were setup on the nut close to the fret board the way i like it already when i got it. i just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference. overall, sounds and looks awesome! would recommend it for anyone on a budget that wants the sound of a les paul.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Kodack review my axesepiphone lp studio deluxe plustopfender maraudertakamine g320squier standard stratsquier standard pj bassbeen playing 20 years.i had a squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar i didn't care about that i could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with. but it got old and i wore the frets out so i needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith. i picked up the lp special 2 in black at guitar center for $130 and they kicked in free strings.bought it for a game, but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good, played so well, and had a killer tone.my lp studio had it's pickups replaced with the zakk wylde 81/85's which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have. imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain, tone, and playability. considering this thing is almost the same prices a bullet squier, it is easily twice the guitar for that price. you literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the special 2.....sound: 5/5two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs, deep lows, and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic. not sure which they have.so much sustain for a bolt on neck. i was shocked.build quality 4/5i did have 1 problem with the high E tuner. i didn't notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4\" up out of the headstock. when i discovered this i loosened the string, whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.intonation required no adjustment.Action was exactly the way i like itneck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.the finish was perfect. no nicks, blemishes, just oily black goodness.neck was flush with no gaps or seams, and professionally shimmed. damn good for a bolt on.hardware is typical for the price but does the job, stays in tune very well.Back bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup. individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts, ie can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but i soon got used to it. no pickguard and it doesn't need one. lots of relief between strings and body. you won't find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick. makes it easy to clean too!truss rod is behind a nice body color plate.frets were smooth, rounded, and played nice. could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.Neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to. i would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top, soon got used to it and it wasn't an issue.500k pots and side body 1/4 trplug keeps the cable out of the way.overall 5/5came with hex keys for setupcame with an awsome poster with all the epiphone guitar modelscame with a nice bumper stickerno manualbody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks, about the same as any other $150 guitar.summary: this guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument i own. it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box. it's well built, plays well, and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music. the frets are medium jumbo's and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical affinity or bullet (2 squiers in this price range).i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music. i did blues, metal, country, and pop. the pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a fender, not as much of those nice fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.one thing i like about epiphones and gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge. this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain. i lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my strats the damn volume knob is in the way.as an experiment i took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if i could get a single coil sound out of it. what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere. the tone was a little brighter and output a little lower, still no hum but you wouldn't fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil. i ended up putting the screws back in.i will likely put my lp studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here i come!) and move my emg 81/85's in this lp special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.do yourself a favor, buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar. it's cheap enough that you won't care if you bang it around a little, and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years.  overallrating 5 lineend
name kodiakcowboy review this guitar is very attractive looking, and plays well right out of the box. i am a beginner guitarist, so please take this review for what it's worth. i am extremely pleased, and don't plan on ever upgrading. this guitar is a darker cherry red wood color in the center than shown in the picture. so expect it to be a different color than what you order. see customer pics.it comes with strings installed and almost tuned. the volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use. the tremble and rhythm switch is far enough out of the way that you're not going to accidently hit it while strumming. my only gripe is that the high E string gets caught on the top pickup when i'm playing hard, but maybe i'm just a novice. i will say that it's very easy to play.everything on it is very adjustable which i also like. the only buyer beware statement i can think of is: you're going to be addicted to it!  overallrating 5 lineend

name Randy review i'm updating a previous negative review. i had some issues with this guitar when it arrived. i couldn't get it setup, the action was very high and i couldn't set the intonation. notes at the 12th fret were very sharp, and i couldn't lower them with saddle adjustments. i missed one vital checkpoint, the bridge needed to be lowered. setup is finished, and i can now agree with most reviewers. for the price, this guitar is far better than any others in the price range. i know my grandson will enjoy it, at least for awhile. if it ends up as a dust collector, i'm not out much on the purchase price. i'll add it back to my own collection, and upgrade the electronics.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Sam review the epiphone les paul guitars don't particularly sound that great, but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price. if your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar, but you're not completely sure if they will stick with it, if you can spend another $100 and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele. the reason for this is because for 1, if they decide it's not something they want to do anymore, you can resell it at the same price you bought it for (as long as it is still in decent condition) and little no money is lost. second, if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a &#34;better&#34; or more high end guitar, mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. i have a couple different high end guitars and i will not get rid of my mexy strat because it sounds great still. i'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Sirius review i purchased this guitar after much thoughtful consideration of other possibilities, but the nearly universal high marks for this particular make and model finally persuaded me to go with this one, and i do not regret that decision.first of all, it is a beauty. initially, i was a little disappointed in that very little wood grain shows through the orangish finish. (my guitar was made in china, which may account for the darker hue.) i thought i had wanted a lighter color, but the more i look at it the happier i am with what i have. second, this instrument is no light-weight, either in heft or playability. it is solidly constructed, very well put together, and plays like a dream. (i lowered the action until i encountered some fret buzz, then backed off the adjusting screws just a bit; that's basically the only adjustment i've made, or likely will make.)it's been barely a day since the guitar arrived and, as yet, i've only played it unplugged. i can't wait to hear how it sounds amped up.  overallrating 5 lineend
name stefanj review i have been playing for about 7 years now and have a tak jasmine acoustic and a jay turser strat knockoff. i really love the les paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the les paul price. i've read just about everything i can on these epi's and finally went to my local music store to try one out. my initial impression was somewhat mixed. the sound was good but the action seemed \"off\" after playing a few scales and a couple easy chords i began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar. then i switched from the rear pickup to the front and bang there was that sound i was looking for. classic gibson les paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat). after playing around a bit more i asked to try one in the cherry finish. they unboxed a new one for me and wow this guitar looks amazing! i sat down plugged it in and played a bit. instantly i was in love. the action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what i'm used to). the sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated. tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar i own (i always retune before every session anyway). epiphone really did everything to capture that les paul sound in a economy guitar. yes i know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body. i point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and gibson electronics. i love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body). even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say i hit a low E last night before i went to bed, and i think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol if your looking for a les paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer. oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else, and they will do a free setup for me after i've played it for a while (so far it's been perfect out of the box).  overallrating 5 lineend

name chris review a friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and i loved having an on/off switch right at my fingertips. genius!i bought 2 immediately. the shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp. works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears.two issues to consider. the right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my tele and my takamine. it would not seat properly and would slide out. i had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side, where it worked, but now the switch is &#34;down there&#34;. i don't think planet waves is the first connector that i had a problem with that so i dont blame them, but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure. second issue is simply that these little button-switches are fussy. you have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them - feel wont do.

name CLKiii review this is my third circuit breaker cable. i play in church and no one wants to here the \"pop\" if i have to leave the sanctuary. why three: 10foot, 15foot, and 20foot depending on the setup for the group - i hate cable jump rope. i really like the right angle connector makes it fit no matter what guitar stand i use.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Ecadad review i purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago, and have always loved it. i only use 3-4 pedals, and this is always one of them. it sounds great, is indestructable, and takes up almost no space. the controls are great, and you can get a large variety of sounds. i have played \"boutique\" chorus pedals, and the boss is loads better in every way. you will not regret this purchase.pros:-easy to use-no hum-small-sonds awesome-indestructabecons:-noneif you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever, will last forever, and sounds incredible, get this.  overallrating 5 lineend
name From review i bought this little pedal back in 1996, about a year after i got my first guitar. i've tried other pedals, but ultimately, this one gives me the best sound. it's very versatile and it's really easy to dial in just about any sound i want. you might get a more dramatic effect from expensive rack units, but for cost and practicality, this pedal is your best bet!  overallrating 5 lineend

name Matt32 review first, let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still looks/sounds as great as the day it came out of the box.its a boss product, which means you are going to pay for what you get. you get the best bang for your buck with boss products. solid, rugged construction that is built to last (no chance of breaking one of these things) and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound. good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your boss pedal, resale prices are always good.while this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds (chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion) here are some of the best uses i have found.1. tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect. perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full.2. dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world korn type effects. this is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much. there are a lot of bands tones i can come close to exactly matching, tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve.3. liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads. this pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out. if you play any kind of christian music you will soon learn it doesn't matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it. walking in on sunday morning and turn out some slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts. chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing, you will always find a use for it, so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rig.in addition you have some great features, easy access battery compartment, accepts a 9v power supply, works well with both guitar and bass, 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired, and all the controls you need to really be in complete control. you have to get this pedal!  overallrating 5 lineend
name SoundSteeler review sweet chorus, i have the ce5, the ce20, a ce3 and this one. this chorus is my favorite, it sounds just right, the analog ce3 is awesome but too weak, boss should include a level knob instead of a stereo control, anyway this one is a keeper!  overallrating 5 lineend
name William review ok... i am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. i was using an old ibenez chorus pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which i did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. i upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the boss ch-1 super chorus to add to the collection. after my first gig i removed the ibenez chorus pedal because of the tonal superiority of the boss unit. i am certain there are units that may boast of being better but, i have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.great tones! easy operation! and it is the best bet for the money!  overallrating 5 lineend
name Denis review i like the product a lot. for me, the only problem is the time of the \"sustainer effect\".it is not so long as i thought. i though it would be like the piano's sustainer. but it's a good pedal effect. my guitar get a good sound with the \"attack effect\". thank you.  overallrating 4 lineend
name John review as several of the previous posters astutely mentioned, 'you will need a noise gate to use this pedal'. i completely agree with that. and it will sustain your notes. it will actually raise the volume to make them sustain. but you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up. the only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate. i use the ns-2 when i use my chain of pedals. that said, this pedals has some wonderful uses. every note will have the same volume. you can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume. you can set it to sustain for days. again, you will need a noise gate. there is nothing transparent about this compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors, but none of them are as \"active\" as this one. perhaps that's the price you pay for what this pedal can do. i recommend messing with it quite a while. you can do some incredible funk, jazz, metal vibes out of it.  overallrating 4 lineend
name JoseAlmanya review man this is perfect! some people says that the cs3 is noisy but i thinks that depends on what type of electric conections you got at home or place you play, if you don't have a independent circuit for your pedalboard there's gonna be a lot of noise, most of all bcuz of the compression (obviously)... for me this is perfect, doesn't make any noise with my conections... tottally recommend this!  overallrating 5 lineend
name SoundSteeler review the boss cs3 is right for me, i have been using it with excellent results, i have many compressors, line6, mxr, behringer, digitech, and although i alternate their use the boss stands out on many rig configurations, it can feel a little bit overcompressed sometimes but in general a very good product, i highly recommended it as your main compressor, if you dont like it probably you dont know how to configure it, good luck.  overallrating 4 lineend
name StormJH1 review it really pains me to give anything but a 5-star review to a boss product, since i'm such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall. those compliments apply equally to the cs-3 compression sustainer. and it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain.however, there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know. the two most common complaints that i see are that it adds \"noise\" to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit. the former complaint is probably true, though if you're enough of a hobbyist to use a compression sustainer, you're probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor, such as the boss ns-2. problem solved.as for the latter complaint (changes tone), that's also true, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if you like the tone that results. the whole point of the cs-3 is that it's supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it. this can result in a muddy, \"neutered\" tone, though you can play with the tone and other settings to help it. i also find that with the settings all at 12 o'clock, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings.really, while boss pedals are considered to be \"expensive\" compared to many of the other effects out there, the cs-3 should really be viewed as a \"budget\" or \"entry level\" compressor, when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a keeley compressor costing north of $200. the best thing you can say about the boss (even compared to the similarly-priced mxr options) is that the cs-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price. the biggest negative of the pedal, in my opinion, is that the resulting sound might seem a little too...compressed.but there are a lot of things you could do with a cs-3, and it works best paired with other pedals (chorus, delay, some distortions) that you're trying to smooth out. ultimately, it's a pedal that could have been better, though there aren't too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $100 anyway.  overallrating 4 lineend
name William review as a pro musician, i am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. i had a bad experience with a few compression pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.when i upgraded my pedal board, i decided to give the idea of adding a compression unit to give my g&l; american legacy (stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. boss is the company that dominates my effects board... i rely on their chormatic tuner, digital delay (2 of them), line switch & direct box almost every night (for gig & practice).with a somewhat negative attitude going into this i had a great surprise to find that i really, really like this unit. it did what i wanted & then some! great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the \"on\" position for most of the time i am playing my electric guitars, especially any stratocaster styled guitar i own.  overallrating 5 lineend
name AF review guitarists have become a bunch of cork-sniffers. there are so many players more concerned with the name on the headstock of their guitar and their amp and the endless \"boutique\" pedals in their collections that many seem unable or unwilling to give a listen to \"stock\" gear, or anything that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.the fact is that if you're a gigging musician, and i am, you come to realize that all those subtle, detailed nuances of tone that so many want to obsess over get lost in the band mix, and in the poor acoustics of wherever you're playing. yes, we want to sound good to ourselves because that's inspiring, but frankly, i don't need $200+ dollar distortion/od pedals to be inspired.i haven't owned a ds-1 in a long time, but recently got one because i was looking for a distortion pedal on a budget. frankly, i'd forgotten how musical this pedal is. with the distortion set to minimum (it never gets clean) it's a good, moderate-gain overdrive that still lets your guitar's basic tone get through. i play a strat & and jazzmaster - those guitars still sound like themselves with this thing. with the gain at halfway you get great ad/dc crunch. and even with the gain maxed out you still get excellent note definition on chords. what more could you want? sure, it's \"old school\" rock distortion. the usual \"may not appeal to metalheads\" caveat applies, maybe. combine this with an eq and you could scoop the mids as much as you want.i also have a barber ltd (great, relatively cheap \"boutique\" moderate gain od that doesn't break the bank) and a visual sound route 66, which is a tubescreamer clone (with much more gain) and a compressor in one pedal. both the ltd & rt 66 have the usual ts9 midrange hump, though much less pronounced on the ltd. what's refreshing about the ds-1 is that the strong mids are there, but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer, so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party. the tone on the ds-1 can get very bright, but as i indicated i play with single coils, and i have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob - i generally run it around 9-10:00.overall this pedal is a steal - look around and find a used one for a good price. i'd considered a modtone speedbox, but decided to go with the generally bulletproof boss instead, for basically the same price. i couldn't be happier.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Charlo review think of this as an artist's tool. and for every job there is the 'right' tool. is this the best distortion pedal? that really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it. if you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles. it will not make your 15 watt solid state ibanez soundblaster amp sound like a raging orange rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like emg 81/85s. but arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise. this pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. it it doesn't make sense, there are ample youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger. it has been used by professional players like steve vai, joe satriani, and kurt cobain. it is a professional pedal used by professional musicians. it's built like a brick and durable as all get-out. i found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair. i would like to see boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly i don't detect any tonesuck with it. i've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking. it also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads. with the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like tech 21, i do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp. so if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your marshall mg, the problem is in your amp.  overallrating 4 lineend
name D. review i have had this pedal for about 15 years, just replaced the old one a month ago. it distorts sound, not quite the way you would imagine though. this effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color. i use it through a epiphone valve jr and a marshall 2x12 stack with jtm45 on top and its fine. this thing through a champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a eq pedal.this does just what it says it does. one volume knob, one tone, and one distortion knob. crank it.  overallrating 5 lineend
name fendertele67 review this pedal is a must have for any pedal board. i love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray. thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best.  overallrating 5 lineend
name From review this was the first pedal i ever bought when i started playing guitar 15 years ago. it's still in my primary set up! the sound it puts out is very balanced: you can get a subtle overdrive-like sound out of it, or a high-gain hard rock/80's metal sound out of it. for those looking for insane crunch, this isn't for you. anyone that wants a nice, versatile pedal, this is the one you want!  overallrating 5 lineend
name James review this is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, you want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it. why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me. this is not a boutique distortion pedal like hendrix would use. boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.these things are built with heavy metal, it should last, i kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion  overallrating 1 lineend
name Jared review this is a distortion pedal. it will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl. it's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion. the ds-1 does not warm up the tone in your amp. you can dial the tone in, but it's a pretty harsh sounding.that said - the ds-1 does exactly what i wanted it to. my amp gives me a nice warm crunch, classic rock style. the ds-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound i wanted, and it does so flawlessly.it took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the ds-1. it's boss, so it will last forever.th only drawback is that it's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere. usually amazon catches up with that sort of thing, but word to the wise, don't pay more than $40 new for this thing.  overallrating 4 lineend

name MetalFan review this pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a boss pedal at $40. the pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my emg powered schecter and tube amp.different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise, it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.the guitar universe always raves about boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.i may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Otto review from greg abrams review, entitled review is to give newer players some information. you have plenty of options for distortion pedals, the ds-1 is not the only thing out there that's affordable. find something you truly love and buy that. if its the ds-1, one of the pedals i've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to you.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Sam review here's the deal with this pedal. it is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. in my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the mxr badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it.  overallrating 1 lineend
name Shady review this is a little more expensive than some other brands, but i think it sounds great and it's way more durable than a plastic pedal.i'm pretty new to electric guitar so i'm not really a distortion and tone expert like some other reviewers. to me this this sounds better and is easier to adjust than my modeling amp, so i think it's a good purchase.  overallrating 4 lineend

name StormJH1 review there's some element of nostalgia with the ds-1 that i've just never understood. i know they're cheap. i know they're incredibly durable (as are all boss pedals). i know everybody had one or tried one at some point, and kurt cobain (apparently) used them with his fenders.but i also know that i've almost never been happy with the tone i get when i step on the pedal. it's incredibly thin and harsh, and lacks proper sustain, even cranked all the way. i've used it on marshall solid state amps and vox tube amps. fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers. you can mess with the tone and dist dials all you want, but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals, and even on-amp distortion, with a richer, deeper tone.coincidentally, i also used the boss os2 overdrive/distortion for many years, which is supposedly merges/blends a ds-1 with an od-1. that pedal isn't ideal either, but if i turn the knob all the way to review because it probably does belong in everyone's collection. that just doesn't mean you'll want to use it all the time.  overallrating 4 lineend
name StudioDude review i know, i know, many people hate on this pedal, calling it &#34;stale&#34;, and &#34;generic&#34;. the problem that they have is that they simply haven't found the right settings on the pedal and the amp, because, after all, the settings on both the amp, and the pedal do make a difference. one thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. i have a digitech bad monkey, and i set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. with this pedal, i have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Victor review this is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. i use it with a fender mustang amp and an ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. it's very easy to use and rugged. if you play metal, you might want to get the hardwire tl-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount, if necessary) and more tone control, but it's also more expensive. but you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the ds-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. the ds-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. i don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Walter review first off i am no expert on these things but i can tell you in the brief period in which i have owned my ds-1 i have enjoyed playing/practicing a lot more with this pedal. i have a fender wannabe guitar, and a fender sidekick 10 which means my gear isn't the best but the pedal produces a wide variety of distortion and tone changes which keeps me interested. i am having so much fun that i don't even notice my fingers hurt anymore. honestly, this is an essential buy when starting out along with headphones and a cord extension so the police don't come a knockin.(update sept 2012)it is a year later and i have a much better guitar and amp and a lot more knowledge. i am glad i got the ds-1 but for other reasons. sure it made me enjoy playing and practicing a lot more but i soon found the sound was off considering i like more blue and classic rock. again for the money i dont think you can beat it but more importantly when you have a few buck you can send it out for modification from keeley. initially i had wished i went with and overdrive (ocd or boss od-3) but with the mod done by keeley i have a super flexible pedal that cover just about all the sounds i need. in closing, spend the $40 buck and get this....and then when you start wishing it could do more send it off to be modified and you will thank yourself later.  overallrating 5 lineend
name aceofbase review good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone (most metal pedals do) and is moderately noisy. if you are looking for classic rock sounds you won't find them here. can get muddy at times but there are plenty of settings to tweak to get the sound you are looking for. i find it useful for high gain leads and palm mute rhythms but note definition is not so good with chords. for the price this pedal is a good deal though!  overallrating 4 lineend
name Alexander review i've had this for about 11 years now. even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market, this pedal still sells well. not to mention, it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. they're usually on the side of improving the stock tone, which i'm happy with.i've always liked the parametric eq on this pedal. the variable midrange allows me to get marshall or mesa flavors. for most metal/hard rock music, the gain range is enough for me. if i need yet more gain, i punch it up with an overdrive, or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. even without a boost, i can use it for death metal. i think if you play the tighter, more technical styles, it's better not to have too much gain anyhow.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Anon review to be honest, i was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to megadeth's first album kimb. so far i havnt got a perfect setup on it yet, but ive got close enough to it. this pedal is great, only a couple notes i should make about it. do not buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock, or just rock in general. this pedal is for metal. the battery drains like a mf. i dont understand why. the only possible explanation i can think is that i leave it plugged into guitar and amp, but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its turned on. i prefer just to get an ac adapter and not use batteries. other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal.  overallrating 4 lineend
name From review i have a lot of pedals... in fact, i have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals (though only the mt2 and the od3 are regularly in my rig.) this pedal won't give you a \"cranked up tube stack\" sound. no... instead, it's very edgy and smooth as can be. it has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone. i usually use it as a mid-boost for solos. you'll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you won't be able to replicate (easily... i'm sure the huge boss distortion box comes close, but for the price...) with any other pedal.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Matt32 review first of all i want to say i love a tube amp distortion. overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be. i run a randall g3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state i've used or heard. for recording i use a peavey 5150 and its so sweet. tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.recently i started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that i felt like could only be achieved through a pedal. there is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, i used the dod death metal for years when i first started playing. however, there is a downside. go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old am radio, if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250. quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.i chose the mt-2 because i know boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using. it gives a variety of sounds. it can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones. the controls make it very tweakable and i have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it. read the included book, look up some mp3s over videos online and check out other guitarists' settings. it will help you tame this pedal into what you want. perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot. there are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.i've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz. i must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig. within 10 minutes i was pleased with the mt-2. i used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response.i say the mt-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal. surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board.  overallrating 4 lineend
name MetalFan review this is a great pedal i picked up used, they can be had cheaply on the used market. i actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit. the 2 eq pots on the front panel make it very versatile, enough to use with a cigar box guitar also.the pedal can preserve bass signal and still be eq'd for saturated distortion. the other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular. i also other boss distortion pedals. like most people, i own a ds-1 and an md-2 which are both cheap and effective. i own a hm-2 heavy metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and i actually think this pedal is more versatile imo with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone.i also own an older 80's hm-2 heavy metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that i could never part with, overall i like this pedal, but it cannot top the older legendary boss pedals.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Devin review this pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years. it really does have a ton of range, although it only does one effect at a time, so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations. my most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock, which produces a very professional sounding grunge-type effect. if you want any of those 90's sounds, excluding the heavier metal sounds, this pedal will definitely get you there.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Rexomus review i first used this pedal when my green screemer died. a friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. i had used boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. so i plug into the os-2 and i was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the os-2 pedal produced. i play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. i have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and i am still impressed. i have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end, my search ended with this pedal. i highly recomend this pedal to any rock, blues, metal, country, or punk guitar player.  overallrating 5 lineend

name Charlo review for the money, i have no complaints. the enclosure, dials, and footswitch are all durable. not true bypass, but none of the boss pedals are. it doesn't suck tone. this pedal isn't the end-all be-all overdrive, but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that ts pedals don't. you lose a little low end when it is engaged, but that actually works pretty well for leads- especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of 'classic' distortion encountered with el84s. as a stand alone overdrive, i prefer other pedals. but where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp. you get singing, harmonic leads when it is dialed in right. like any overdrive, you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far. i am a dirtbox hoarder and i like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations. lately, i am running this into either the v1 cool cat transparent overdrive (timmy clone - very, very nice) or the behringer bo-100 (which is a dead ringer for the boss blues driver) then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch (jet city combo or palomino combo). as with any overdrive, this thing will not sound very good (imho) running into a solid state amp. that's just not what it was intended to do. it was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but ymmv. because i'm a cheapskate (and because these things are durable like bricks) i bought it used for $20, but it is well worth the new asking price.  overallrating 4 lineend
name F. review it's yellow, its metal, its boss. if you want your drive sound to have definition this is the pedal to get. the best od i have ever owned. makes me want to see if my tone could cut board in half.  overallrating 4 lineend
name From review i picked this up in order to boost my gain on my amp a bit. it does a wonderful job of that (drive set low and the level set high. tone set to taste.) the additional noise it produces is relatively low, so you won't have any excessive staticy buzzing sound to deal with. as with any other boss pedals, it's well made and reliable.  overallrating 5 lineend
name G. review bought one of these 15 yrs ago used and it died a couple years back. this is one of my favorite overdrive pedals ever. smooth tone, the right amount of gain, perfect to push a tube amp. plus there are now dozens of (diy or pro) mods available which add a lot more potential. recommended.  overallrating 5 lineend
name MetalFan review i bought this pedal used and have used it with both a fender tube amp and a marshall solid state using clean channels. i can get a variety of tones from it with different guitars, and reccomend it as a first overdrive or to add to a collection.while i have several overdrive pedals, this one is good at giving some basic overdrive tones while keeping the amps low end. i can get decent tones from a telecaster and les psul by keeping the level and tone knobs below 12 o'clock and adjusting the drive to taste.the od sounds great through fender clean tubes and i also tried it with a bass guitar. with some adjustment of the tone and drive knob, the bass has an overdriven tone with a good drive.the other reviews here prove this pedal is typical and iconic boss in build quality. i find the boss pedals good for their purpose and have mostly modded the ones i've owned after some time, but i may keep this one as is and use it as a boost. these pedals last forever and i only paid $20 for mine.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Rick review this is a standard on my peral board along witht he blues driver. this little yellow box is the most bang for your buck you are going to find in an over drive pedal. it is tough, sounds like fire, and will serve you well. for $50 there is seriously no better deal.  overallrating 5 lineend

name StormJH1 review i held out from trying the boss sd-1 super overdrive for many years. like many guitarists, my first distortion pedal was a boss ds-1, which was durable and aggressive, but also extremely frustrating. i might have formed some negative impressions about boss, when it was probably unfair to do so.the sd-1 is widely owned and very affordable (usually around $50). it's similar in a lot of ways to the ibanez ts-9 tubescreamer, except that a tubescreamer reissue costs twice as much. a lot of guitarists consider the sd-1 to be more of a review s for reasons that aren't fair. you hear things like \"it cuts out too much bass\ when that's really what the pedal is supposed to do. the midrange hump, when set up properly, can take away the muddiness of your tone and help you cut through a band during live playing. and, like i said before, i feel as if it's more transparent in retaining elements of the clean tone than the ts-9, though preference between the two is entirely subjective.but you also know that it's a boss pedal, which means it's as durable as they come. the thing will stand up to years of abuse, and can be used in any number of roles. if you're looking for a single pedal to make a small amp sound \"big\ there are probably better options in this range. (try the under-appreciated md-2 mega distortion, or the excellent joyo ultimate drive). but if you understand what this pedal is supposed to do and use it for that purpose, you'll understand why this thing has been popular for over 30 years.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Tim review great as a booster, as others have said. for solos, it'll boost your mids and your signal. as an overdrive, it's great, kind of a midsy, marshally sound. it does suck out some of the low end, but you can fix that on your amp or board or whatever. it's a boss, it's solid - and a great price. remember, this is overdrive - not distortion. for distortion, look at other boss pedals.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Victor review i have several overdrive pedals, some of which are much more expensive than the boss sd-1. for a long time i overlooked my sd-1 and used other pedals. but when i went back to trying the sd-1, i was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals i had been using. i don't mean merely that it's \"very good relative to its price\"; i mean that it's \"very good--period.\" it easily outclasses some pedals for which i paid much more. the price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about $45 on amazon. at that price, it's an amazingly good deal. note: this is definitely an overdive pedal; it will not deliver metal distortion (at least not by itself). if you want to ride the crazy train, look elsewhere (like deltalab's metal distortion pedal). what this produces is smooth old-style overdrive. it's excellent. it sounds especially good through a dash of chorus. i plug my sd-1 into a fender mustang ii amp and turn on the amp's chorus; the result is delicious. i've used the sd-1 with both single-coil and double-coil pickups. both sound good, though, not surprisingly, you get a heavier punch with a humbucker. but it sounds great with single-coils too.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Cali review forget all the volume drop comments. there isn't any and it does not color your tone one bit. i have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals. they were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in. i wanted something to dress up slow ballads, and of course \"born on the bayou\". this pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it. and no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on. i play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Dako review sure there are fancier tremolo pedals out there, but i've always been a fan of the boss tr-2. it's got a more mellow and vintage fender tremolo output, and suits my playing to a t. pair this beauty up with an electro-harmonix cathedral reverb pedal, and get lost for days. definitely worth the reasonable cost!  overallrating 5 lineend

name Guitar review this is a great tremolo pedal.it is very quiet and when used correctly, there is absolutely no signal drop or volume drop whatsoever.you can blend the tremolo type from a smooth sinuous pulsing waveform to a sharper edged \"on/off\" type tremolo.tremolo varies the volume of the sound. it does not vary the pitch.you have control over the \"depth\" or \"amount\" of effect, and you can control how fast the effect pulsates the sound.a very simple, popular effect that i wouldn't want to live without in some form or another.pretty teal green color.as with all boss products they are built like a tank and generally last forever if they are not abused or damaged.i have no idea how fast this pedal eats batteries because i use a power supply.there is no on/off clicking when depressed.there is no added hiss, hum or distortion.the battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything.simply a great effect and quality product from boss and tends to hold its resale value well.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Todd review i've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it. i'm old school, fender blues deluxe reissue and strats and teles, this pedal has a great, warm, organic feeling tremolo that i use a lot. you can barely bring it in for some warmth, or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.i'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck. this effect will give you a nice almost hammond b-3 type of organ sound.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Victor review this is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] its dials allow for enormous control of the effect. [2] it's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of boss pedals. further, [3] it's utterly easy to use, [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation, and, most important of all, [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo. (note: it comes with a 9v battery installed, but it does not come with a power source/adapter.) if the price is more than you're willing to pay, consider the danelectro cool cat tremolo. this also delivers good tremolo, but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the boss product; it's still quite good, but the boss takes the prize. i paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Violet review i own three units capable of tremolo: boss tr-2, line 6 mm4, and the boss sl-20 slicer (like a tremolo on steroids). plus my amp is a twin reverb so it too has tremolo. if you are unfamiliar, tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidly.the boss tr-2 is the simplest of the three stompboxes to operate, with three controls: review s suggest, and this is something i am sensitive to because i generally turn modulations on/off over the course of a song rather than leave them on full time.like all boss stuff, the box is sturdy and i like their big, quiet footswitches over any of the little, clicky ones on other units. the color is a sort of a dull military dark green, not the most attractive thing but not bad either.the small boss effects do not come with a power cable, so you will have to factor that into the cost. boss instructions tell you that you need their particular adapter, but i don't know anyone who says this is a must. i run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine. if it didn't i would not buy boss product period.bottom line:(1) gives a decent array of basic tremolo sounds, nothing crazy(2) not a bad price (factor in a power cable)(3) simple to operate(4) nice casing and footswitch; drab color  overallrating 5 lineend

name K. review this is the best little guitar pedal adapter i've used, and i've used many over the last three decades. it's exceptionally quiet, which many are not, and it puts out 9.6 volts, which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. and you won't have to buy a new one every dozen hours!i've used this on a splitter to drive three pedals, but at four and up i can hear the current drop a bit. still, that's a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers, not a box on the floor. but it sure is nice to have some gilmouresque delay, and a little extra gain driving the tubes, and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that i know of, including the boss ones. dan has released some cool, well-made pedals in the past 15 years, and this little wall wart is a worthy companion.a very good deal at 15 clams.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Marktwain10 review as stated in the title, this adapter is what you need if you use your danelectro a lot and are going through too many batteries. you can now plug it into the wall! as advertised, it keeps electric current hum to a minimum and has functioned fine for the year or so i've owned it. the reason i took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesn't seem too durable, so because of this i have been very careful so it doesn't get broken. you might be able to find an off-brand adapter for cheaper but this one is made for the honeytone so you won't risk ruining it.  overallrating 4 lineend
name Risenheart review ...is a must if you have any of the danelectro/fab pedals. as anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9-volts like candy, this is the solution. you get one of these and hook it up to a power splitter (search for visual sound one spot multi-plug 5 cable) and you are good to go for up to 5 pedals! no more battery swaps, no more searching for a 9-volt every 5 minutes...  overallrating 5 lineend

name A. review my first wah was a morley steve vai bad horsie. i loved it. it's a switchless pedal that i put through hell. i had it for 3 months before i had to send it back cause it broke. it's still an ok pedal but i wanted the ability to leave the pedal \"open\" to achieve a certain warm sound. that's when i went looking at the cry baby.at the local retailer they had several different kinds of cry babies set up. i put this one against the hendrix, classic, and 95-q cry baby pedals and this basic one sounded by far the best. the only one that sounded better was the 535q but at over $200 it was out of my price range. i paid $97+tax for my gcb-95 cry baby and it was worth every penny. i don't even touch my morley anymore. it's cry baby all the way  overallrating 5 lineend
name AF review i've been using a crybaby for going on 30 years now. some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way. well, i've never noticed.to me these always feel perfect. also, you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little \"comb\" that moves the wheel on the pot.i've tried other wahs. morley doesn't do it for me, and the vox is very good, i just have always gone with what i knew. no complaints with the crybaby.  overallrating 5 lineend

name aspiring review my experience with crybaby is it has a great tone. more overbearing than the vox or cleaner wahs. but i know several people who have had problems with the switch, and i have watched countless others stomping on their crybaby in futile attempts to engage or disengage the pedal.i actually use a bbe and vox since this frustration with my 1st wah. but i am not sure that i am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance! i kinda think i am. the vox and bbe seem to have a brighter sound which is less \"wah-ed\" if you will. it could be accentuated by me playing a strat instead of the les paul custom/boogie combination i used with the crybaby.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Paul review i've had my wah pedal for a number of years now. what i can say is that it has put up with a lot of use, no problem with the pedal itself, mechanically. however, the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product. that is to say, the rubber feet began to come off in no time. if you mount it on a pedal board, you will probably remove those feet and this won't be a problem. also, the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal. if you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable, at least on my unit, the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat. what i have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push all the way in, otherwaise, zap. other than those two issues, the power issue really no fault of dunlop's if you use the supplied power cable, its been a great pedal. a classic that will surely live on.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Anon review so i bought these because being dunlop, i trust the brand. i dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky. the only problem i have is, they scare the piss out of me. its not a \"tighten washer and nut\" situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks. these have pegs that insert. its so hard for me to trust these, i always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp i clench my guitar. so scared that the little metal balls things will just slip, peg fall out and ruin a $500 guitar. i havnet had a single problem with this system yet, and i never hope that i do. but if it happens there will be an update to this. good product so far, just wouldn't recommend it. there is too much crap in the world to be worried about, strap locks shouldnt be one of those things.  overallrating 4 lineend
name aspiring review the screws are too long for my very thin bodied gibson sg classic. i can not find shorter screws which fall into the pin so that the straplock will work either---the heads are all too large.i believe i used these on my gibson les paul custom years ago, and they worked perfectly. not on my newer sg though--at least with the new screws it comes with.fender start appears to take the system well--only time will tell.  overallrating 4 lineend

name BigSteph66 review almost dropped my bass on the floor a couple days before i got these bad boys. when i put them on i felt confident that i wouldn't have that issue anymore. it's easier to strap up because of the quick release tab. this should be every bassist/guitarist's best friend.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Bilbo review i tried this model a few years ago, and i never had a problem with them (once i got it installed), but i went back to the schallers i had on my other instruments. i thought (and this has been mentioned by others) that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument, which i thought looked goofy. i also didn't particularly care for the push button release, and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a c clamp, not a nut, so there's no allowance for differing thickness. i also felt safer with the schallers, which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didn't depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together. as i said, i had no real problems with them, so if they look like they'd work for you, great. as with all replacement strap locks/buttons, you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers, dropped out of airplane, or what have you.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Chris review great product, i've use them before and have always thought they were top quality. they aren't much larger than the originals that came with the guitar and that extra piece of mind is great! easy installation without any modification (at least on mine) and they connect/hold very solid. just make sure the buttons are all the way in or you could have mishap ;)  overallrating 5 lineend
name Christian review they work well. for me, the instalition wasn't that hard, it took me maybe four or five minutes. the screws provided were a bit bigger than my bc rich avenge beast's stock strap system, but when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap (or wax- i used the bar soap though) the installation becomes easier.once you put your strap in, its not comming out unless you try hard to undo the system, lol.if you need to clean your guitar strap, take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip. its a quick and harmless way to do it and it may take about a minute or two to undo both strap locks. its not that hard though and the reward is worth it.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Delta review no complaints about this hardware. easy to install with patience, easy to use. the click on/off system securely holds your strap, and prevents the strap binding from slipping off the post.these work like a light switch...on/off, so i'm not sure how you can rate them as poor. there aren't really any directions, so it takes a little mechanical knowledge (just a little...it's not rocket science) to make them work.quality metal, secure function, and easily replaces posts on instruments already equipped with standard strap posts.i've installed these on a 3/4 hoener, full sized squire acoustic, and 2 fender strat's.  overallrating 5 lineend
name DMGenest review after receiving thedunlop dual design straplok systemalready installed on my gibson standard electric(7.36 lbs.), and liking them, i decided to try installing them on my gibson studio electric (7.23 lbs.). noproblem. just follow the instructions exactly and they will work perfectly.i had no problem either installing them nor using them since the installation. money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground. besides safety i also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars. it's a nice convenience. if you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars.if you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions. you've got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly.what i don't care for, but feel okay with because they work so well, is how big they seem to be. theydon't get in the way when being used but look almost out of place. that is why i chose black for mysecond set. helps keep the product's profile down a bit. other than that, the product works asadvertised....note: as of june 2014 i have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected. do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure. after repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens. do not use any glue in case you need to swap out the straploks in thefuture.  overallrating 4 lineend

name Hitthespot review this is the first time i've used the dunlop straploks system. i've always used the competition. these work just as well. i guess you just have to make sure you lube the little ball bearings once in a while.  overallrating 5 lineend
name HLB review what's great about the dunlop design:they work! the only thing you need to do is ensure you've got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i.e. just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear-end off without worry.the design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around/rotate on the post, which is exactly what you want. the schaller ones (see below) have a major flaw in them from my family's experience. we will never run anything other than this design going forward.what doesn't work with the schaller design:our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using shaller-style locks for a while now. every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p-bass...not good. my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend. the problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself. we've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.we tried to make the shallers work but just could not. maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.  overallrating 4 lineend
name IBZANE review straplocks have been around for a long time, but now you can use the instrument with a regular strap as well, this dual design sold me on it..easy to install on the guitar. a little difficult getting the lock mechanism installed on the strap, still only took about ten minutes to do. the added security of knowing your 1200 dollar bass isn't going to hit the floor makes it very well worth the small cost of this item..  overallrating 4 lineend
name Jake review i have never owned a straplock system prior to owning these dunlops, and boy am i amazed! every straplock system i've used in the past, on friends' guitars, semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim. in contrast, these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - it's great! better still, the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes, making installation trivial. and the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that i think i could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch, using the posts like the oem ones. this is a great system, and i would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar.  overallrating 5 lineend

name J. review these came stock on my jackson kelly kexmg. all the other guitars i own have schaller buttons on them and i have one main strap i use for all of the guitars. i figured since the guitar came with them i would try them out. not twenty min later i was removing them and putting schaller buttons in their place. here the 3 major reasons i did not like them over schaller:1- bulky. they stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- problems engaging. i would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. it wasn't until i forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- cheap. they just feel cheap. thin metal is used in comparison to the schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.for a few bucks more i'll stick with schaller's. i have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.  overallrating 1 lineend
name J.C. review i've been using the same straploks on all my guitars for the past 10+ years. i have not had one fail on me ever. just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it's on right. i've struggled with the c clip in the past, but what are you going to do? it's a one time thing when you first install, so it's no biggie.  overallrating 5 lineend
name Jeffrey review . once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. so if you are stuck with a set, here's what i recommend:go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1\" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (they are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. it doesn't need much. i used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. while you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!  overallrating 2 lineend
name John review sorry, i don't like these as they're just too big. they stand out too much. they do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. there are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap. again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. i also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like i should be wearing big purple platforms when i play. not cool.  overallrating 2 lineend

name JPfromOH review the dunlop dual design straplock system is a sturdy, fairly easy-to-assemble and easy-to-install alternative to guitar straps slipping off of instruments. the screws that are used to attach the straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty large--there's little chance that these are going to come out. the locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance. the only disadvantage of the dunlop system to schaller's system is that the the dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitar's body. ordinarily, it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences. on an instrument such as a hofner \"violin\" bass, though, or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument, this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support. schaller's strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players. the dunlop straplok system is sturdy, should provide a long life of service, and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors. recommended for most guitar body styles  overallrating 4 lineend

name Harry review long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. so when my strings wear out, i got this. now i feel like playing an emg bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, without the power that an emg pickup has to offer. yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like seagulls...bottom line, i recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. if you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Robert review the wire clipper and winder work o.k., but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn't slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out. bad design by someone who doesn't use it to pull pins out of a bridge. i end up using a jim dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out. i've done it successfully for years.  overallrating 2 lineend
name someguy2011 review header says it all. works well enough as a string winder, but i was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me, this did not work well at all. went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Tinfoot review i honestly really didn't find this thing useful at all. first, the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesn't open easily (very stiff action), so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick. and as for the winder... i suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. but it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything i used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help. didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing. just looked at it... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.each time i have set out to use it, i end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string. i just recently ended up buying a set of crescent brand miniature cutters & needle-nose pliers set(the pliers are just the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding). when i have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar, i'll try the notch bridge peg puller. but other wise, this thing gets a serious two-star &#34;meh&#34;.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Bob review i purchased elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store. put them on my eko ranger xii acoustic 12 string. have 2 problems with the strings. first, the bass e (11th string) broke while tuning it up. had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not elixir). i have changed strings many, many times, so i am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the e string itself. second, the high D (8th string) seems \"dead\"; it does not \"ring\" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets i've used). considering these strings cost much more than others, i certainly am disappointed in them. hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Tony review i bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone i was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. installed as usual and tuned them. they sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. my capo could not even hold them. i set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. when i looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. i released the tension on all the strings as fast as i could and left it. i returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. the body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. use at your own risk!!!!!!! i personally wouldn't give a nickel for them.  overallrating 1 lineend
name Darkrin review not two weeks after i put these on the a string broke close to the ball on the string. i break high e strings on occasion. but something as thick as an a string?? maybe it was a defective string as i thankfully bought two sets and i was able to pull the a out of the other set and it has been fine since. now however i have the dilemma of should i just buy more strings and just use the second set as i need them. further more do i stick with the same brand. that is supposed to last longer than average strings. at this point i am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there. i will update once i decide if i should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky'supdate 3/25well another month went by(a week ago) and the d string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe i either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be. either way its losing another star. if it happens with a different set of strings i will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly  overallrating 2 lineend
name khoney review i bought these strings after buying some elixir strings for my acoustic, which i was pretty happy with. for my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. after about a week i really started wondering if it was just in my head or if i really didn't have sustain that i thought i usually got from a new pair of strings. i convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and i was right. i put a pair of d'addario xl 9.5 (highly recommended for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain i was losing with these elixir strings. i did feel like i could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently. don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of d'addario or ernie ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings.  overallrating 2 lineend

name M. review this is an update to my original review because i have now fully tested two of these capos. i'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here. i'm not sure how it's possible. i've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim dunlop capos. i had purchased two, which i have now given away to student players as i cannot use them. i tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar. the e string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. both capos had this very same problem.when i received these capos, i noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual jim dunlop capos. the craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official jim dunlop capos. the rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product. as a professional musician, i need to purchase reputable brand-name products because i can't afford to have my gear failing during performances. i have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation. when i contacted the seller, they were not honest with me.  overallrating 1 lineend
name Andrew review i know many people love the design, but i find it much too frustrating. you have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly, then snap it in, then turn and turn the screw, oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw. then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again. what a farce. this is the worst capo i've owned, and i've tried nearly every brand and type. yeah, i've had people show me how to do it right, and i know to do it right. it's just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on, snapping it, screwing it in, screwing it off, having it fall off, forget it, it's garbage to me. also, while i'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day, the last thing i want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw. it's actually slightly painful to the fingers (momentarily, but why have to deal with that??) to work with. this design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it. the only good thing i can say about it is looks durable.no thanks.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Paparaptor review i recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. one was in the skb fender case ($99.95 on amazon), the other in this gator case purchased locally. i was told it was just as good as the fender case. both ended up in checked luggage. after 1 flight from florida to lax and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up. the padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case. neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, i just ordered another skb fender case. the gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips. the skb fenders will be my airline cases from now on.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Dako review i don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school. when you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.it'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. i just don't like the features of this stand at all.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Josh review i've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting. this one is the worst. the plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle. bad...just bad.secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp. it seemed loose after i got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement. after twisting on it twice i stripped it out. now the thing is worthless. i'm returning it asap.i would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing. do yourself a huge favor and buy the nady 6\" pop filter. if you don't, you'll wish you did.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Confidential review i've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. mainly due to the low cost. they work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. the guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. my biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go \"flat\" sounding. these are not quality strings at all, just cheap chinese made quality. they are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. better strings are worth the extra cost. you actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. i've had this problem with all the d'addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. the thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. the tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster.  overallrating 2 lineend
name D. review i have played on d'addario before, actually the first string i started out on.super light's are ok, but can wear out real fast, so, it's importent not to put to much stess on them.....espescially if you do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's, etc they will break. any skilled guitarist know's to use extream caution when tuning....any strings,i did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them) i would not recamend these for beginer's, cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out.personally, i don't like d'addario's at all, i find the tone to bright.  overallrating 2 lineend

name just_keith review this was bought based on the advice of others. i had a cable with the standard neutrik/switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.it worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. it happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that i swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. after confirming the guitar was okay, i tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.d'addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. you also have to get r.a. taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. the extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. in my case, i bit the bullet and did what i should have done the first go-round and got a really nice dimarzio cable.again, this cable sounds good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. the good news is that imo high price is not a guarantee of any cable sounding good. the replacement dimarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. i don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but i want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. this one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.so the replacement that planet waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. i figure i'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. if i have a few $ for the shipping and d'addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, i may get it replaced. more likely i will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - imo it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.if this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, i'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. and if d'addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. idk how much r&d; it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what i would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. that would not make it a deal breaker.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Sweed review well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks. bought a new fender mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago. last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. messed around a bit and it started to work. today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp. thought i had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy. got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either. at least my new amp is working and i only have to replace a $12 cord.maybe i'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if i bought it at a local store i'd return it. not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund. will just move on to another company's cord.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Victor review i have several mxr pedals. every one is superb--except for this phase 90 (the non- review ed here). this phase 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. i did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (look up \"mxr phase 90 mods,\" and \"erik's corner\" will show you how.) i made the \"r28,\" \"c11,\" and \"c12\" modifications. the result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. finally, i tried adjusting the internal trim pot. on no setting could i get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. i spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. no luck. bottom line: if you want a phaser that doesn't add significant distortion, avoid this incarnation of the phase 90.  overallrating 1 lineend

name jmhr review if you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a guitar > volume pedal > amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a poorly engineered pedal. it can't be review .)it does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (not \"true bypass\" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal. i will need to try that out, but it does not excuse ernie ball from their responsibility. major fail on their part.2 stars is generous because eb fails to honor the simple \"first do no harm\" principle. it harms your tone. how dumb is that? the pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though i have my doubts about their \"string\" mechanism over time. the rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.i have no recommendations for a volume pedal. because of the feel, and esthetics, i do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver.  overallrating 2 lineend

name patriotsarebest review good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice.this was my first guitar strap i had ever bought. i didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by. over the 6 months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic i recently got and it keeps popping off. this is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house. the guitar could take that head dive of death, while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse.my advice: unless you plan to sit and play (which you wont really need a strap anyways) the whole time, spend alittle more to get a leather strap. spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play.  overallrating 2 lineend

name tj review i bought a glaesel bridge & this glaesel rubber mute together. i bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews. the mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works very well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing. there is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on. also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.if you want or need a mute for practicing quietly (as many of us do), i suggest you buy something else. this item does not work and is a total waste of money. i tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new electric violin bought here on amazon (fyi, that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item! just make sure you buythe original peg drops by ardsley& aglaesel self-adjusting 4/4 violin bridge mediumwith it!).i consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all. it does not mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way.  overallrating 1 lineend

name animulvr review need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) i have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently i needed and ordered some and i found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). guess these are too cheap for fender to have qc on.will try other brands next time.  overallrating 1 lineend
name Dako review i've ordered two of these kits in the aged white, and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate. literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor, accidentally stepped on them, and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale. the knobs, covers and tips are all in great shape, however.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Kreature review these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings. these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch, ernie ball strings are garbage, the only time i will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh, you can spend 4$ for a set of ernie ball or d'addario every 2 days or you can spend $7 for a set of dr strings and change them once a month, or you can spend 10$ for a set of elixir polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months, it doesn't make sense to use these crappy ernie's unless you are sponsored by eb and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars,  overallrating 1 lineend

name Hayden review i bought one of each soft, medium and hard wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the hard is as soft as the soft. they felt exactly the same in fact. the medium was the hardest out of the bunch.packaging error? i have no idea. the fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. so check with what you get.sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.there is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that i do not think it is idea for strumming.the only reason i can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Vivid review ok, it was cheap (nine bucks at the time), the design looked good and sensible, and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need. i bought it without hesitation. however(!), once hooked up, i was very surprised how flimsy it is. i have a 13\" gooseneck, a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it. at the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand. obviously, any small bump into the stand will once again set this off. using it at home, i've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful, but obviously this unit is far from ideal. since then, i've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand, and though i haven't really put through its paces yet, this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable, and only costs a few bucks more (on stage msa9508 posi-lok sidemount boom). for anyone considering this product, i highly recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the on stage msa9508 posi-lok sidemount boom. you will be far far happier.cheers!  overallrating 1 lineend

name Samuel review the version i picked came with a grounding wire, claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic-producing snap, crackles, and pops. if you believe that, continue to do so, and maybe you'll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device. speaking more pragmatically, i've found some use for the item only when loose, conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc.  overallrating 2 lineend
name luiszo review i purchased these as well as the jim dunlop 7000 locks. i recommend the 7000 model. they both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way, but these are just to big and clumsy. the 7000 model does the same and doesn't take as much space. you will need the straps to either be thin at the ends or your strap buttons/pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units. this is true for either one of the models. i have a regular nylon 2&#34; levy strap and these two models (7000 and 7007si) work well, but i prefer the smaller, rounder model (7000).  overallrating 2 lineend

name Clayton review i bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what i found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something). the release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.bottom line: if you don't mind the extra effort and don't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using, then maybe you will enjoy it. for everyone else, look elsewhere.  overallrating 2 lineend
name CLS review barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer's defects ... the unit does what it was meant to do. i do however question whether the word \"pro\" should apply to this system. although the 1/4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer, the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system. the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about. to its defense, it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away.after playing with the device for a couple more minutes, i noticed that any movement whether i kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and i moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception. even the length of the mic cord, whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality. yikes!!! perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which i previously described above. i'm afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes. i'll probably be returning this unit asap.  overallrating 2 lineend

name HLB review our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago. every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p-bass...not good. my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.the problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself. we've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.we tried to make the shallers work but just could not. maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.  overallrating 1 lineend
name K. review no where on the description does it say that the mic clip is not included. the only place is on the box after you have received the item. there's no instruction (which is fine). but in the product description it doesn't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can't use it.i bought this and have it shipped second day because i need to use it and now i can't because it doesn't come with a mic clip which i have to spend another 5-10 to get it plus shipping. the price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip. but without it, i felt cheated.  overallrating 2 lineend
name garmenteros review the only reason i'm not giving this one star is that i didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. i got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. we have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. nope. this pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way. avoid.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Ecadad review i purchased this as my first guitar slide. i loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. i almost cut myself! i will never buy a glass slide again, i recently bought a dunlop brass slide and love it. the difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. i would not suggest this to anyone. the metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. there's a reason all pros use metal! the review below is wrong. slides are meant to cover your entire finger, all the way to the tip. you don't bend your finger to play slide. you retune your guitar to an open tuning. just thought i would point that out.  overallrating 2 lineend

name D. review dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and i have used the standard model for some time. it seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.i used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while i was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.later i wound up trying the humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a dreadnought, i took to putting the dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a planet waves microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it. then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. worked great.so i ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. they now ship without the clips. company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though i didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. more importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when i pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. so i sent it back to amazon for a refund. no problem getting the refund, but i'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.if you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the om model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Vivid review i wanted to like this. i really did. the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;perfect&#34;. however, the unit i received was cr@p, and i'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. the one i got kept cutting in and out. you might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. and when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. frustrating.i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. the so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. bummer. any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?cheers  overallrating 1 lineend

name Sunn review i ordered one of these because i like my other planet waves capo a lot (i believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;lite&#34;). however, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a martin jumbo acoustic). it will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.i'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. it doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as i can tell. unless i just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, i wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.my recommendation is the classic kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). if you are looking for the screw-down style, i would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;lite&#34;.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Hayden review i have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, i have had enough.the main problem with this tuner is the usability.the tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.the needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever i pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.the poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.enough said, i bought a new tuner, the seiko sat800, for a bit more money that this.the main differences between sat800 and the ca-40:sat800 has a build-in light, ca-40 does not.ca-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, sat800 does not.sat800 has a auto and manual mode, ca-40 has auto.sat800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1e, 2e, etc, ca-40 displays only displays the alphabet, e for all oactaves.sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off, ca-40 does not.the needle graph on the seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner. i was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on amazon and i hope you would not be.  overallrating 1 lineend
name TWM review this tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. as soon as i insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low b flat and stays there... even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end. at first i thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, i also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input.  overallrating 1 lineend
name BAT review i've been very disappointed with this tuner. when i've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right(sharp) then back to the left(flat). i have two(2) other tuners i bought from wal-mart and i always get accurate tunings from them. i bought this korg because it's a brand name and the company has an outstanding reputation. even though my tow(2) wal-mart tuners are older, they both still work better than this korg.  overallrating 1 lineend
name Joshua review there are better tuners out there. far better. this could be good, but it seems to me that all korg products seem to think of standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to standard (especially when tuning the g string)! i personally play exclusively in standard for my electric playing, but sometimes i want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. this piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using \"f\" or \"c\" notes. i have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (i say that with love) that play in open tunings. trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Reviewer review this one is probably closer to a $150 guitar. the fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it's just like most of the other made in china guitar. from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200, but i'm not at all impressed. one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they're a jack of all trades but a master of none.i recently bought a johnson jg-610-n, a johnson jg-620-n, a bristol bd-16, a jasmine s35, and this yamaha. if i'd only played the yamaha i'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side i can definitely say it's not at all amazing. the bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better. the johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish. the jasmine is nice but i haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.the yamaha fg700gs is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low end punch. now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great. the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison. also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit \"hive mind\" where everybody buys into a hype. maybe i got a dud guitar, but i doubt it, they're all made in the same factory.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Bloose review i bought this to connect a technics tt with an audio technica cartridge to my newer onkyo receiver with no phono input. the unit did work but i had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume. in addition i have an onkyo m3040 connected to the receiver that i use for as a zone 2 amplifier. with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp. they are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop. i do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.this unit may work perfectly fine with a behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all. i am returning it.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Daits review the mixer is good for the price but i had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside. the packing way below average. as a matter of fact, it was the only outer box without any cushioning. after seeing those ups and fedex delivery videos i would not pack a ups or fedex shipping item in such a poor packing. however, the great seller ( i am referring to amazon) immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit. second unit too had the similar packing but no damages. worked fine.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Seventh-777 review considering the price is so cheap on these, i took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. to say that i used it \"rarely\" is an understatement - maybe once a month when i have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vdrums and a bass di through my powered wedges. that said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume all the way up.aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. however, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Austin review i'd give this 1 and a half stars if i could. this little amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it. it is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this. i can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output, and hardly anything in the other. i have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second. i can still use this, but hardly. i really don't like this.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Scott review if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. pay the extra money and get something quiet. others complained about this and they were right. if you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. some complained about each band boosting others. this is more of a user problem than manufacturing. if you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. in this respect, its like an mxr 6 band.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Charlo review i picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store. who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right? the price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well. the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate. it gets you in the ballpark, but just barely. strike a note once, and it's sharp. play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune. i think the korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better.  overallrating 2 lineend

name C. review i bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage. i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d-28, but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.imagine my profound disappointment.really, boss??? this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours. this thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the review s on-line. seems like it is part of the design. it's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. totally unusable, as far as i'm concerned. by the way, i tested it direct to a pa as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat).  overallrating 1 lineend
name Johnny review summaryacoustic sounds &#34;ok&#34;, but noisy in weird ways. i returned it. price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.pros- boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable- standard 9v power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs.- variety of acoustic sounds possible. (personally, i only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- while i have several boss pedals, i think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small. i prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.details:the basic concept is good. i had an ac-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. it wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. it was also just noisy in the pedal chain. adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. however, i sold that model because i didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and i wasn't happy with the sound. at the time, the ac-2's were selling for about $85 new. boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac-3.i bought the ac-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the ac-2 -- and they did, a little. but not enough to keep it. i returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. i think the ac-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead. they make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;. the 400 has reverb on the pedal. i opted for the 300 and got it for $25. i expect the durability will be lower on the behringer than the boss as it has a plastic case. however, this is an effect i pull out just once in a while and since i can buy 4 or 5 or 6 behringers for the price of a boss....if it breaks...i'll just buy another.i also have a boss gt-100 multi-effects unit. you can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the behringer or out of the boss ac-3. the least cost effective of those choices is the ac-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.i'm not saying its a bad pedal, i'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. if they would fix the noise issues, i might have even kept it. i did opt to keep the behringer for those times i'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. this boss pedal just didn't work that well for me.  overallrating 2 lineend
name F. review i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac-33 acoustic amp. the pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy. however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate. this is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch. the worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out. the only way i could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made. for the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that boss would put out a better product. i also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question. i would highly recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site.  overallrating 1 lineend

name C. review the good:this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.the bad:the tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination, unless you like hyper-distorted noise. the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied. the effects are hit and miss as well. plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive.throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, i'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones.  overallrating 2 lineend

name mike review i heard great things about the s6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, i bought it based upon reviews. i've played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:- the seagull is comparatively unattractive. its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- the cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- the laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;/resonant during playing.- the satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- the cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok.- the binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something i've not encountered before.- i can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!all in all, it is an ok instrument that stands out simply because it's made in canada for asian/mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. in fact, for the price range, i can get a just-as-good asian/mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.i don't regret getting it, but i feel like i overpaid for what i received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, i have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. seagull to me is over-hyped.thanks for reading!  overallrating 2 lineend
name tommy review it sounds very artificial, i remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had, now that i use it with a better amp, it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it's not even worth the price i payed for it before. i also had bought another one to replace the first one because the input section jack got messed up in the amp that it didn't want to lock with my guitar cable and when i took it apart, there was no way for me to fix it other than sending it to be replaced. shitty pedal.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Anthony review i am a tone freak. i bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff. at the time i had never owned a big muff. i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound. i later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff. the difference was huge. the big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box. i later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging. i am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal. i would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space  overallrating 2 lineend

name @ciscoza review these cans were decent, back when they were just above 100 bucks. they've inflated to 160 and that's just ridiculous. there is better in this price range. the srh840's for example on ebay for 120~ bucks new, does everything better than these cans. the m50's have really punchy bass, and extremely stringent highs, they're very loose in the low end, and their mids are recessed. that combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience. the pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable, whilst having an almost starchy texture to them. the headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath. these phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all, which means for gaming, these will be pretty terrible. they do some... some... new genres alright, but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to. they also can't do lighter genres like jazz and classical due to their poor positoning. there are much much better monitors in this price range than these, the shure srh840 as i've said before totally outclass these headphones in all areas.stay away, don't fall victim to the noob hype.  overallrating 2 lineend

name David review i purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price. after trying to use it i promptly returned it. i do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows. i have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer. i tried recording on the h2 using it's line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my mackie sound board or my stereo receiver. no matter how i set the levels the recording on the h2 was very distorted. i played with the record levels and the agc and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal. i have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean, good quality sound. the problem with my h2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal, which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp. recording from the internal mics seems to work fine. i have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the zoom recorders are the only brand where i have found this problem.the h2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings, look for something else. i exchanged this model for an h4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal, but not as bad as the h2. i finally ended up getting the tascam dr-07 which i am very happy with. it has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Carlo review i ordered this plug because it is advertised as a &#34;1 spot&#34; brand plug. it is not what i received. instead i received a generic plug for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose, but a really cheap version. the plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic. the original 1 spot plug has much smaller plugs, great for saving space on a pedal board, and the wires are soft and &#34;rubbery&#34;, again making it easier to work with on a pedal board, specially if you're working with a pedal board like pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars. i informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one. in my email to them i included an image of the original packaging of the 1 spot 8 plug to make sure there would be no mistake, but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug. i emailed them again for a refund, which they promptly did. i can say, that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money. i imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 spot plug, wouldn't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors. i strongly recommend, spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 spot 8 plug.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Nuri review i used ac30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these.sound quality of ac30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrendous clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.for people worried about construction, these turned out to be very sturdy (ac30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same).even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy ac30, the latter has acceptable cleans..  overallrating 2 lineend

name ANorton review these speakers worked great for 14 months. last week (4/8/13), one of them wouldn't power up all the way. the problem is getting worse every time i try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working. it seems there is a problem with the capacitors that i did read about in a few reviews. i took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. i only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. i contacted m-audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. one on the east coast and one on be west coast. i've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the internet and on the m-audio support site. m-audio doesn't stand behind their products, and i'll never purchase anything from them again.  overallrating 1 lineend
name G. review on the plus side, these monitors look and feel amazing. they are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.they don't sound horrible. i mean, they are not computer speakers or anything. the sound is very forward, i would say harsh. that's not uncommon among studio monitors. there is definitely a lot of clarity here. not a ton of bass, but that's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size. there's a few schools of thought on studio monitors. some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music, others think they should sound more like a normal speaker. these will be more pleasing to people interested in the first. i definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this. any flaws would be quite noticeable.i previously used krk rp8's so i can compare these to them. granted, they are larger and more expensive, although they are also budget monitors. i liked them better than these. they were clear but also sounded nicer and, of course, had much more bass.i was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in...see if i could improve the situation...but one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it's turned on. the buzz increases in volume over time. i tried moving them to a different location, turning the volume down, even disconnecting the audio feed (so they were only plugged into the power). nothing stopped the buzz. if they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds. so i sent them back. i wasn't really impressed with the sound and i'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so i'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead. maybe behringer 3031a's or something. i think it's worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full-sized monitor.  overallrating 2 lineend
name R. review sound nice, but very unreliable bx5a deluxe.i own a pair of yamaha ns 10s and event 20-20s, and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.2 years ago i purchased a set of regular bx5a's, and they lasted about 1 1/2 years, and then the faulty capacitors leaked.i just replaced them with the bx5a deluxe model, and after only one week. one of the internal amps will no longer power up.i need a pair of affordable av shielded monitors that i can depend on, and these cheap m-audio monitors are not it.I am back to using my 20-20's with slight av noise until i find a decent av shielded monitor.m-audio was a much better company before avid took them over!  overallrating 1 lineend
name Mark review in an attempt to see what's new in the pick industry, i decided to dive in and give these a go. they are way too flimsy if, like me, you use a heavier pick. i have always used dunlop tortex greens and these davas just can't compete. not only were they too flimsy, but when i played with any aggression (heavy rock-based material), the picks would fly out of my hands. this was a huge disappointment.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Rock review this is an affordable copy of the boss harmonist pedal. i bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature. but was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with.anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay. and on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem, hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise. also the pedal just started oscillating a few times. i would have given the behringer us600 five stars if it kept working, it tracked nice and didn't tone suck too bad.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Jared review some things are great values, others are cheap. the behringer is cheap. the clips are cheap. the clip that holds the 9v broke after the first change. the clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic. if you get stuck using batteries, plan on 3-4 hours worth of use. it's also a noisy pedal. like noisier than my dyna comp and od pedals combined. like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise. if you leave it plugged into your cables, even when powered down, it will eat your batteries.all of those negatives aside, you are paying less than $40 for a reverb pedal that has several usable features. the 63' spring is great, the plate is also really good. it also has a worth-the-price-alone \"space\" feature. also known as shimmer (a synth playing behind your instrument). paired with a chorus effect, you can get some really cool tones.the rv600 is not without merit, but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features. if you gig or record and need a reverb...well...you aren't even looking at this pedal. if you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn't have a reverb built in, this is a good option.  overallrating 2 lineend

name cincinnatislim review i had some issues with my 18-watt all tube amp so i experimented and replaced all the tubes. issues not only continued but worsened. hum, noise, volume fade, unwanted distortion at low volumes. i eventually put back the original el84s and that didn't help. once i removed the tung-sol 12ax7 preamp tubes and replaced, the hum stopped, sound quality of the amp was consistent, quiet and back to par. my experience with the tung-sol tubes was very, very negative. they caused me to go out and buy another amp. i had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast. i'll never buy this brand again.  overallrating 1 lineend
name RobE review don't buy this chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand. it is barely workable for two.it is easy to set up, but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place. and you absolutely have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.the best thing these stands are built for are v type guitars such as my jackson rhoads as long as you can put them back to back. for les paul and strat type axes, their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow, stick like feet of the stand, especially when they are new. you can't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible. so this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand. if you just gotta buy something from on stage, get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced. but really, you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.this is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for.  overallrating 1 lineend

name NW_OR_USA review i purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when i placed my guitar in it. upon close inspection, the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube. the tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe 25&#34; wall, so don't expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off- even if it is welded better than mine was. just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs- it is literally that thin of metal tubing.for $10-11 i did not expect perfection, so to it's credit- it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars.this stand does have one other good quality- it is cheap! since it was less that $11, i cannot see going through the hassle of returning it. i was able to carefully weld mine back together- but this would probably not be an option for most. the stand might work fine if you don't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up- but if you need portability and durability- i would definitely purchase a better quality stand.  overallrating 2 lineend
name LJS review this is a fantastic product that is well made. the plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use. this ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition.the tool is extremely useful. i have just started playing with a band, and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in. with the wheel, i immediately know what chords to choose from. i also know what notes are in each chord. in addition, it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing.the wheel is also invaluable for switching keys. for example, say you're playing the i, iv, and v chords in the key of c., but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in bb. all you need to do is dial the wheel to bb, find out the new i, iv, and v chords, and start playing. the wheel makes chord transposition a breeze.i feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair. this is a very useful product at a fair price.no, i am not affiliated with the company at all. i'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool.in my opinion, this is a five star product.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Mark review my issue with the pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply. i have a voodoo lab pedal power 2 plus.the documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply. however, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.first of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board. the fitment to the power supply is there... sort of. there's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together. i wasn't worried about this, since i doubt i'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.the second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter. once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out. you'll probably have to break them. it's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.the main issue i have with this board relating to my voodoo lab power supply is this. once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board. you can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.i really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the voodoo lab power supply i own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, i wish i could return this board - except i can't, because it now has holes drilled in it. (you have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it.)basically, i paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro. needless to say, i'm not very pleased.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Bret review from the product description, i expected something far more robust than this unit. by and large, i've had great experiences with behringer pedals, but this reverb unit is the wimpiest i have ever used in 40 years of playing - no stronger than the reverb in a 5w first act amplifier.  overallrating 2 lineend
name James review i bought one of these for a vintage fender showman that doesn't have built in reverb. put a battery in and plugged it in. very simple. but the sound was horrible! no setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb i ever heard or would want to hear. the closest i could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful. on the other hand, the reverb from my korg ax-100g (that i was using on another rig) was great. maybe my dr600 was not functioning properly, but i don't think so. i think that's the way it really sounds. so i got a return authorization from amazon (very easy - never fails), put it back in the box and ups picked it up the next day and i got a full refund.jm tepper  overallrating 1 lineend

name David review i purchased the h4n after being unhappy with the h2's performance most significant where i couldn't record a good sounding signal that wasn't distorted with the line in jack. only to find that the h4n has the same problem but not as bad. if i try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the h4n's 1/4 inch jacks, it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal. it appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp, adjusting the gain doesn't correct it. i contacted zoom's tech support about the h2 and was told that i likely had a defective unit. i returned the h2 and decided to give zoom another chance and try the h4n after seeing many positive reviews.i really like the h4n's design, the menus and controls are nicely organized. it feels more sturdy than the h2. the recording quality using the built in mics is excellent. most other recorders in this price range don't have xlr inputs. since i plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board, if the line in jacks don't work properly and can't accept a normal line level signal without clipping, i can't use this for what i bought it for. i have used my sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems. i've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the zoom products are the only ones where i have encountered this problem. if you are using this to record with mics, it works great, but if you need to record from line level sources, the zoom recorders may not be a good choice. i exchanged this for the tascam dr-07 and while the tascam doesn't have as many bells and whistles, it is a nice recorder and i'm very happy with it.  overallrating 2 lineend

name jsnchmpn review i really wanted this to be a great product. the screws strip out too easily. basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out. i had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon. nope. even the pop filter fell off. i love the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage... ex: adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc. otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option. just make it one solid piece. i'm tempted to try to fix it with gorilla glue because i do love the design. it's just not strong enough. not that it's a surprise though. not much of anything is worth the money these days. it's a damn chore to return every friggin' purchase these days that they don't really have to care about actually testing products. why should they? they already have your money. i feel like i should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up. besides, what are they going to do? replace it with another broke a$$ product? better yet, refund my money for the product i paid - minus shipping???? that doesn't include the time i spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place. i want a refund, plus an hourly wage. whatever, don't buy one. companies that don't test their products don't deserve your business. what would make me happy, is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question(s): did you test this product? how did you test it? what were your results? is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence?nope  overallrating 2 lineend

name G.R.K. review so the problem with most reviews is that people generally review things as soon as they get them when they are still in the honeymoon phase about it. i've used this in my jam lab for 4 years and use it every time i play electric (about 5-7 hours a week.)the unit itself has held up well. no problems with case or pedals. all switches, knobs, plugs, & display work fine. it doesn't have a on/off switch but that's minor. it's low profile and is easy to switch by foot. i have it going into my mixer which works fine. no feedback or buzz from it.i like the recording software, cubase, that came with it. i didn't think i'd use it much but i do. it's fun and easy to record my own songs. cubase is a little quirky and will often tell me that there is an error and it needs to close, but i've learned nothing happens and it's fine.i don't use the looper much as i have it before my digitech jam man. which, if you don't have, you need it! the drum presets are fun to use. it's a blast to set a drum track, loop a rhythm, then jam on top of it. isn't that what it's all about?my two gripes are the tuner and clean presets. the tuner is not very accurate and i use a cheapo tuner that works much better. also the tuner is supposed to be silent but it isn't. some flaw i guess. also the clean presets; like acoustic and clean bright sound cheap and weak. i don't like them at all. the distortion presets are awesome from some tube overdrive to massive fuzztone. they rock. i use alot of the other ones as well.imho this the review ...i still like it...alot!!

name Sam review these types of pedals are toys. they are a cheap way for a beginner to have effects to play with. by all means if you are buying it for your kid who just started playing. if not, i recommend slowly building your pedal collection and use the money to get 1 decent pedal whether it is a delay, or distortion.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Big review ok, i'm surprised that this unit is now over $15 0. i only spent $8.59 for this and i'm mad at myself. it was cheap enough that i rolled the dice to see if i could get away with a decent product for cheap. it feels solid, looks like a real direct box...but sounds like ass. i couldn't believe that pyle would put that much effort into a great \"fit and finish\" product, yet not put decent components inside. this is the noisiest piece of crap i've ever used - i ended up buying another direct box (spent over $60 0). pyle has once again lived up to it's name, but they should finish the name properly and re-brand as \"pyle of s .\"sorry folks, but i'd skip this one. the 5-star ratings must be from employees. the only reason i didnt' give it one star was because it was so cheap (remember, i only spent $8.59), and i'm the one that pulled the trigger on the purchase.live and learn. why would i think plugging a $2000 0 guitar into a cheap piece of crap was a good idea? my fault.  overallrating 2 lineend

name HLB review our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago. every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p-bass...not good. my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.the problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself. we've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.we tried to make the fender/shallers work but just could not. maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Josiah review i bought this as a cheap way to amplify my acoustic. learned my lesson. should of just forked over the money for an a/e. i have a yamaha f335 i really like. i say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so i thought i'd try it. i first picked up a transducer for about $3 and experimented. i like it, sounded good then i saw this from axl and i thought i'd try it. installing it wasn't bad except i bought a set of drill bits i didn't need for $10. so i got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright. i just wanted it for playing around at home so i didn't need real great sound quality. but sound was ok except it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves i think quick connect strap connector. my other complaint is i couldn't turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching. overall product quality is good. setup was ok. price was good. sound in my opinion needs some tweaking.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Drew review i've been using primarily alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them. i figured i'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.these were the first to go on, and they were a huge step down from what i had on. the strings i took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string. they were twice as loud as these. when you take these out of the pack, they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti. they don't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do. the cons definitely outweigh the pros here.pros:-very flexible, string bends are easy-easy on the fingerscons:-the most dull sound of any strings i've ever heard. especially on the low end. they're dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound. the highs are very tinny. almost sounds like a bad recording.-your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings. it's the weirdest thing. this is especially true for the g string. it's hard to explain, but it's kind of like rubbing against something really clean, where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there's tons of squeak to boot. anyways, it sucks. grip is the last thing you want on your strings.bottom line: unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings, these should not be purchased. i'll never buy again. this is the first time in my life i wanted to change brand new strings.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Humbrecht review if you've never had a pedalboard before i'd say pass on this one and look for one that is more user-friendly. the pics and description don't show just how insanely large this is. it's too big. patch cables are crap and the power supply didn't seem sturdy enough to be kicked around.besides this, i had trouble using it (even for practice) because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals.i ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a gator 'bone' and a seperate power supply. easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics/cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it's own.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Karl review i bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps. if you want the metal sound for practice, then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill. but with the hybrid amps (vibro champ) going for not much more, you get better sounds and more settings. i am selling mine and ordered a super champ xd used in new condition for two and a half bills. this line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding. from now on its tube amps for me, even if i have to pay the price. a good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well, too. like i said, for a first amp at one bill, the line 6 isnt too bad. maybe some day i will be able to afford a princeton reverb?  overallrating 2 lineend
name Ian review before i purchased the fbv i scoured the web to see how it works with the pod hd desktop, and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking..anyway, i lucked out and found a used one going cheap, and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the pod hd desktop & fbv express ii combo.1. first, in the setup screen do not enable the fbv express. yes, i know this sounds dumb, but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for...2. read the fbv express users guide and calibrate the pedal.. there is no need to d/l the fbv software for this.now.. in the pod setup screens you have the option to either have the abcd buttons as abcd, or to be fs5-fs8. this behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the fbv.so.. in abcd mode you can:a) select preset a, b, c or d from the group you are currently in.b) insert a volume fx and use volume pedal...exp2c) insert another fx enabled by toe switch, and controlled by pedal as exp1d) tap temp (by tapping the currently selected preset..ie the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press/hold the current selected preset pedal)f) you have some basic control of the looper, but cannot enable it.3/10/14 edit :looper control is flawed. you can record and go to overdub, but you cannot record then play/stop the loop.. you can stop from overdub but not start the loop. seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugnice enough, but if you are like me, switching presets is way way less useful than switching fx blocks on & off. incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns od on, and delay & chorus both off, or turn one amp on and one off (channel switching).. yay!! you cry, that sounds like me so its a no to abcd and mode fs5-fs8 it is for me!..so yup in fs5-8 mode you can do that, you cana) enable/disable 4 sets of block(s) using the four pedalsb) use volume and expression options as above (ie like volume or wah, overdrive level, delay fb etc)c) basic control of looper but cannot enable itedit 3/19/14 looper control flawed as stated abovec) enable the tuner?...oh sod it. nope you can'td) tap tempo?.. nope not that either.so in summary, the express is better than nothing, but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop.. the shortboard is worth the extra, or if you are reading this before buying the pod.. get the hd500x instead.  overallrating 2 lineend

name James review i was looking for a portable fold-up stand that i could take to gigs and searched around. found the guardian at amazon and thought for $10, how could i go wrong? oops! wrong. the stand is sturdy and folds up nicely, but i found it next to impossible to get my fender jazz bass to stand up in it. the lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn't blow. this is ok for a lightweight acoustic that you don't care too much about, but for for an electric guitar or bass, no way.I just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support. live and learn.  overallrating 1 lineend

name John review im starting a podcast. i blindly lept to buy the blue yeti. i can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this. great for voice overs. in sound proof studios. the sound quality was good but it picked up way to much room noise. the ability to select the 4 recording modes is great. if youll use it. i would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this. however recording a choir or something would work. but i will never do that and neither will you. this microphone only has a usb port. not XLR. so no hope of expanding. if you ever want to host a podcast with 2 people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and 2 new microphones.or you can do what i did and get 2 audio technica atr 2100's, 1 behringer xenyx 802 dual mic input mixer, 2 shock mount/broadcast boom combos and 2 windscreens for the same price as a yeti, raidus shock mount, the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand.now i can replace my mixer and keep my 2 mics, or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for 2 hosts on my podcast.do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever  overallrating 2 lineend

name Wynn review for any usable tones while playing live, the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp. direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring.I didn't like the recorded tones either, much rather preferred amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasn't an option.that being said, it is good for practice and song writing. used this for more than a year and finally sold it! that's the other thing with items like this, they lose value real quick once the next version comes out.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Coolkayaker review s on amazon). i own other herc stuff, and it's all ideal, and for a few bucks more, i could have had that lifelong-use stand instead of this one. oh, well, for once, i got cheap. and got burned for it.all in all, not great, this tiny stand. one stand fits not all. perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand, but i think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments. you may think you can bend the lower forks, but it's hard to do, will require a vice, and if you see on the amazon pictures, the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves, so if you splay it out like it should be, you'll change the way it fits in the grooves, and thus it won;t work at all. it's just an imperfect design. my take on it, your mileage may vary. bye bye.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Cooper review at the time i bought, was $16. mine arrived broken, so it had gone back. reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken. not upset about that - stuff happens. it is just not a good stand. light construcion, unstable (topples easily) and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped. the 'protective' materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft, shiny runner like materail and it 'sticks' to my instrument's neck. so i pick up uke and i get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity. happened every time. yes, i tried out the stand even though broken, and it proved to be a bad choice. back it has gone. 5 stars to amazon's return policy, thouh!  overallrating 1 lineend
name Hayden review let me first start off with the sizing. when they say \"fits soundholes from 33.75\" - 35\"\ they really mean it.you are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 1/16\" smaller than the specifications.i know i did. my friend's oscar schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well. the edges did not \"catch\" completely and it looks terrible.my classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole, it did not fit at all. you could try cutting the edges off the oport at the fretboard.the main issue is the sound.yes, it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming, slightly but enough to tell.however, it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes.fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before, even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes.for me, that does not justify it.a simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less.another thing i found out was what was amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new.the packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened. does it matter? in practical terms, no, not for this sort of item.i guess that is how amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies.  overallrating 2 lineend
name TerranautX review perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound. be advised that i did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike. as strictly an issue of natural acoustics, i found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar's output and resonance. i have an aria ad-80 which is a very well-made chinese attempt at cloning a martin d-42. it can not compete with the real Martin but for the money i paid it was a great buy and it is known as a \"sound canon\" for it's great natural volume. adding the o-port deadened the lows. it just didn't provide any plus at all anywhere else. it is however pretty inexpensive so if you're a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it's not going to break your bank. but again, if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person \"voiced it\" in his or her manufacturing process, this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything. i'm an acoustic nut and i'd love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box. the o-port seemed to \"corral\" the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole. sorry to be a crab about it--i like planet waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the \"humidipak\" recall a few years back. but this product was a waste to me.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Coffee review no matter how many times i hard reset my 3gs, no success. there is no problem with my jack, and the phone is in pristine condition -- no problems until now. there is definitely a connection and communication because the mic and sample track work, but that's about it. i registered my amplitude app, and followed all of the instructions on the box. i tested the irig with an iphone 4 and was able to get it operating.i am giving this two stars because it did work on my friend's iphone 4. but for my purposes with a 3gs, it is a brick. if anyone has any suggestions that lead to successful operation, i will re-rate the product.  overallrating 2 lineend
name skeletonbears review this is a pretty decent thing for practicing your guitar through your iphone or ipad. but if you want to use it for any recording at all, even demos, i strongly recommend going for the irighd. the hd sounds waaaaaay better, and the build quality is great. this guy, not so much. there was always a bit of noise with my old irig, and it seemed to get worse over time. it also felt kinda fragile and chinsy. if you look, you can usually find the hd somewhere for $80; a $50 difference is significant, but the jump in quality (and likely longevity of the product) is definitely worth it. i upgraded and would absolutely do it again.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Jared review my review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more. when i first got it i liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first i thought it was great. then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.after all of that i finally realized i was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. go to the fender forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.the thing happening with this amp i think is a few things. fender guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a fender, and i don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, i wanted anything but a strat body, unless i have a grand to pay for an older one, i'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and i would only get one after i got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people i've read the complaints i was trying not to realize, as i didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, but i did!and i am so glad i did. i almost got a peavey vypyr, and i am glad i didn't. this amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which i read on fender's own forum/website, fender acknowledges it exists, but does nothing to fix it in future models!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.i've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and i was like review s of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying \"throw away your pedals, you won't need them\" and \"i was going to get pedals, but don't need to now\ that's kind of the danger of these amps, they end up making everyone sound the same! no matter what tweaking i was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.i think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and i've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but i needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.i think if i played this at a gc i wouldn't of gotten it, and i just tried to make myself like it.  overallrating 1 lineend
name scottfwi review could be a fluke, but my unit was defective straight out of the box. plugged it into the macbook pro, fired up garageband and right away it's midi connectivity was intermittent. then it had some stuck notes. then it stopped being recognized at all. it still got power from the usb bus, but no MIDI, no sound. the jack was visibly wiggly, too.so, you're mileage may vary, but mine obviously had a defective usb port on the back. rather than bust it open and get soldering iron, i returned it and bought an m-audio oxygen 25 for $20 more.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Teagan review i honestly don't see the purpose. it doesn't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar. i've used it a few times, but don't see the benefit.edit 5/30/13:after coming back to read the other reviews, it's obvious what happened: this was shipped to me completely dry. there was no grease/lubricant qualities. it was like a dry erase pad. they need to improve their quality control. i'm changing my rating from 3 star to 1 star. they have to find a way to fully secure this gap or maybe consider enhanced vacuum sealing packaging.i would suggest if you receive this product and it hasn't dried out yet, to place this product in a air-tight ziplock bag to reduce the likelihood of this drying out.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Adam review i purchased this amp locally and initially, i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds. this was my first fender amp as well.the presets were neat and all, but when i played around with some of the review s online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the fender support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues. apparently, the mustang i and ii don't have these issues, and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp. is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? there is speculation that the lcd screen (which is not present on the i or ii) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and fender doesn't seem to care...definitely try this before you buy it. you may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.this amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. i am disappointed that fender hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that fender reps say that know what is wrong, but i'm not taking that as a fact...), but they have acknowledged that there is \"something\" wrong.whatever... i took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and i picked up a 100 watt marshall instead. guess what? the clean channel has zero hum or buzz, even when cranked. how about that? even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise.i'll knock fender for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that i'd like to try. but before i buy another fender amp, i'll take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Rob review a great idea, but pure crap in terms of functionality. if you don't have something heavy on the flat end, the rubber piece moves, and before you know it, your axe is on the ground. i saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight, but i'm not so hot with that idea, especially if the can is open. the lip need to extend down longer, and something needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around. if i had a permanent place to mount this, i'd gorilla glue it down, but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and i'll get an extra guitar stand instead. good idea, but it doesn't work.  overallrating 1 lineend
name Wayfinder review i purchased this instrument brand new, on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that i simply could not ignore. it was brand new, unopened, in box. they allowed me to examine it prior to purchase. in that environment i thought it a nice instrument.however, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store, and that store was very busy and noisy. it's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.this is indeed a 6-string ukulele. it measures a bit over 28\ review . i know some will disagree. but others know exactly what i mean. this isn't an expensive instrument so one really can't expect super-fine quality at this price. however-- i paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom. as mentioned, the cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and i was able to return it. i simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options-- and frankly, there are.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Review review i ordered one of these (from mf) and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches didn't all work. even in perfect condition it's still a subpar case. but the one i got had two ripped corners on the lid, and from those rips it's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around, and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing. as for the latches (buckles), there are three of them and on the one i had only one worked to keep the case closed. the other two latched, but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.disregarding those flaws it's still obvious that it's not a good case. the hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment, the handle is not comfortable to hold, and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag. it also won't stand evenly on end (if that's important to you).on the positive side it's light, it does fit a telecaster ok, and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment. but do yourself a favor and spend another $25 and get something better. i have a musician's gear dreadnought case and this doesn't compare to that one at all.  overallrating 2 lineend
name MyBeesWax review right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was way off (fretted e note on the 12th fret too sharp). after the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. next, i proceeded to adjust the intonation. i was able to get the intonation for the a, d, g, b, and high-e strings spot on. however, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted e note on the 12th fret was still sharp.i also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-e string intonation.i love the red burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). unfortunately, i'm going to have to return it. i'm going to get a squier strat instead (with either amapleorrosewoodneck).---[update november 15, 2013]i ordered the squier strat direct from amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. i contacted customer service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until december. then, to my surprise, the squier strat was delivered yesterday! yay!! :d the happiness!!i was able to get the squier perfectly intonated. it's red burst like the legacy (fender calls it antique burst). it's a beautful guitar and and i'm loving it!  overallrating 1 lineend

name Beach review downgrade to 1-o star after returning it back to brookmays, the seller:i am really disappointed by the seller, brookmays', ignorant responses to my return of the defective cherbub guitar pickup, which picks up unwanted noise by the wire's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won't have the same issue. after two weeks of the returned item was delivered, i didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so i emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap. too bad, four days after the email had been sent, i only got the email of telling me the case# of the message i sent without any further response to my refund. until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and i don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money i spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. therefore, yesterday, i emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to amazon about the bad after-sale service i ever have before if i still haven't heard from the seller shorty.today, i finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, review after using it twice:i like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings. besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description \"regardless the surrounding noises.\" i have distressed from those unwanted loud noises. one more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that i use, and i have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. however, when i switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either. i don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup i got ... i bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, i can't accept the noises and i have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. so, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, brookmays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description. good luck then!  overallrating 1 lineend

name Wayfinder review first we have to realize this is not a $200 pickup or even a $50 pickup. it's less than ten bucks.it has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar. as such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole. it also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole, as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.it is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices. unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4\" to 1/4\" coupler (to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord). you will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.it is a passive pickup, so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device. if you don't have a preamp system, this will do you no good.So because of the limitations i rate it as above. for what it does though-- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments, it does okay. i believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money, including adhesive-disk mikes. i would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from. but this is a slightly different concept (removable) that for the price is worth checking in to.  overallrating 2 lineend

name tj review i own the sn-8, which btw, is the best tuner i've ever used. i bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin. so i wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin. i was also intrigued by the &#34;tighter&#34; tuning aspect of the bars on this. let me tell you, if it worked, the bars may have been a cool feature, but when you are fine-tuning an a string and it tells you you are on e (when you know you are on a bc the other tuners all say a, and it matches the piano), then there is a problem. i could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing, so it looks like it's just defective. the one i received was completely useless.I am amazed at the great sn-8...i am disappointed in this thing. i must have just received a dud (i hope, since these usually get good reviews), but i will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly. on the flip side, i will be getting another sn-8 in it's place, since i know those are great tuners & i love the one i already have.  overallrating 1 lineend

name MojoMMjojo review it was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china. any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell. if you can wait a month for delivery or longer, if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up. if you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too. i have decided to build my own  overallrating 1 lineend

name JdoubleH review compared to the snarksnark sn-1 tunertuners, i really like the low profile / leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. the snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. this works much better in that regard. this one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. it mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine. tuning accuracy? hard to say- it just indicates high / low / on pitch, really. i prefer the more precise and wider scale +/1 readout of the snark. they are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. but this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.the negatives, and why i can't recommend it are as follows. the battery cover on mine fits very loosely. i worry the battery will fall out very easily. i may end up gluing it in place. it isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up i think). the second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user- that's right, sideways. on a bass, i don't really need it to tell me which string i'm plucking or tuning, but i still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it. it wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow. i just can't for the life of me work out why they designed it this way.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Pa review i bought this with the idea i was getting a pedal that would give me usable marshall amp sounds. after trying for a couple of hours, i find that it won't do that. i guess my combination of guitar and amplifier wasn't meant to be used with this pedal. the guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control, he was spot on about that (very annoying effect). nothing but praise goes to the supplier ( kdm distributors) . they did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country. but the pedal itself, not for me.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Steven review .the 2i2 is a simple set-up. pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a \"low-headroom\" instrument to it, run the usb cable to your computer and set it up within the daw described parameters. it would have been nice to know that the included plug in suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with ableton live lite and that it could be found it in the plug-ins section of ableton, but i figured it out eventually regardless. (ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly.) sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!i wasn't sure for a very long time if this was user error, an ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, i screamed \"ballsdogit!!!\ and purchased a license for reaper. after going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new daw over the last few months, i began to realize that my monitors no longer \"lock up\ but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!i had to tweak the living daylights out of reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors. now i'm in there and the fx do not work with the focusrite drivers. garbage focusrite! everyone i know that has reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface. i have yet to experience a crash, but i also have yet to experience any recording time.seriously, i started reading on the reaper forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from david@focusrite actually saying that \"you should not use this setup to record electric guitar..\ and that if you need to record electric guitar you should \"get something with more headroom like the 2i4.\" that is just unbelievable in my eyes!i'm sure i could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should i have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? besides that, i'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!this device is clearly marked for both xlr inputs and 1/4 instrument ins. there was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and i researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit. i feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology. how in the heck does this thing have a nearly 5 star rating!!!????the good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm. i have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well. i constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the focusrite scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products.sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here.  overallrating 1 lineend
name Vivid review hi folks! ok, this thing is cheap. that's cool. but a cheap item you can't use is money thrown away. before buying this i had read various reviews of some folks liking it and others saying it's too small. well, i want to clear this up once and for all. it is too small! specifically, it is too short to reach across all six strings if you go past the third fret or so (depending on your guitar), and it doesn't open wide enough to be able be slid down past the third fret, even on a skinny neck. this thing really is a puzzler. i mean, who the hell would make capos this size, especially when they could've made capos that actually fit for the same production price and sold them at the same price? someone somewhere is just plain ass stupid. however, a positive from this whole mess is that i finally found a capo to use with my ukulele, and for way cheap, ha ha. but if you are looking for a capo for a guitar of any size, this is utter garbage. cheers!  overallrating 1 lineend
name Amazon review this isn't a terrible tuner, and for how cheap it was, it wasn't a \"ripoff\". however, it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim. when it does work, it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner. however almost all of the time it's fluttering around to completely different notes or just not reading a single thing. i try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and it's the same. it also did not come with batteries, and replacement ones aren't cheap and are very hard to find. i don't think this is a terrible product due to the low price, but if you want to be taken seriously and take your own music seriously, get a real desktop tuner. a cheapo one is only 5 bucks more and you can find real, full sized, affordable batteries for it...  overallrating 2 lineend
name L. review tried this and was not happy. seemed to want to be off too much. got the fender ft-004 instead. this one does have a great view on the led, but if it doesn't tune right, what's the point? i would try the fender. just a note. if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner. i would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing. just a thought.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Michael review i have had 2 of these tuners (you'd think i'd learn after one). they calibrate okay , it's just that they tend to break where the swivel ball fits into the socket of the device (both of mine broke this way). to me, for the price, it's made cheaply. try d'addario instead; love their tuners.  overallrating 1 lineend
name L. review i know the old saying you get what you pay for and that is just the case here. the unit is very light weight and the legs are too small to hold any decent mic like a rode m1 mic or similar.i knew at this price it might not be great and took a shot, but i opened one, tried to use it and can't. it was a total waste of money, but doesn't pay to return it. i suppose if you have a small mic that has basically no weight to it, it might serve your purpose. again, you get what you pay for and these are indeed budget light stands.  overallrating 2 lineend
name R. review the adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap, a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately. replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand. they are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting, good enuf okay i guess. but after transporting and reset, i found them to be junk.  overallrating 1 lineend
name sid review big disappointment. i've been so impressed by epiphone's but this one didn't do it. quality of manufacture and assembly great. pickups far less than inspiring. yes, it's a great platform but was so expecting those p90 sound. i may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it. just didn't have the tone and bite i was expecting.i could certainly invest in some pup's but i have too many great p90 guitars to bother. roll of the dice i guess.  overallrating 2 lineend
name J. review installed these on my schecter c-1 hellraiser. i had very high hopes for these, but as with any new over-hyped technology, they failed to impress me. the only good thing i have to say is the tone is good. but realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings. you would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison. so now that i have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse. they are not silky smooth feeling as advertised. if anything they feel worse than regular strings. last but not least: they are bad for frets. just like stainless strings; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick. i don't know about anyone else but i don't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years.for the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear.  overallrating 2 lineend

name Fender review i've owned more than one overdrive pedal in my 30 years of playing guitar and the only one i still have on my pedal board is the boss super overdrive...sweet baby is well on the way of living up to that legend as well. i have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal. it really does react to your playing style. unlike other overdrive pedals i've used this one really gets smooth when you back off of your string attack and starts to growl the harder you dig in. as far as the pedal goes it is pretty much the same as a lot of them...instead of a tone knob they call it \"focus\ there is also a volume and drive knob. the sounds i can get out of the sweet baby are some of the best i've ever used and easy to dial in. i own a lot of pedals but lately i keep my chain setup real simple...the guitar goes into a ehx-crying tone wah pedal, then the sweet baby, then a boss super overdrive (used as a lead solo gain boost... i don't use distortion pedals.), next is an mxr micro chorus followed by an mxr carbon copy analog delay. the whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my fender deluxe reverb amp. i use the foot switch that came with amp to turn on the tremolo when needed... i play mostly blues and classic rock. the sweet baby is well made and i don't see it failing me anytime soon. you can spend hundreds more on name brand pedals but what works for me at the end of the day is alive and well in this \"clone\" overdrive tone blender...update: this pedal has since been returned. it went out with me on a few gigs and didn't hold up to life on the road. the connections inside the box came loose and became a major problem before a few gigs...i have since put my boss super overdrive back in the chain...while i truly loved the tone from this product in the end you get what you pay for.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Fender review let me just start out by saying that i've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. i still own most of these units except for this one...the joyo compressor. my setup is a very simple one...starting with a stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah, super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. i don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals i've tried over the years but i know why you want one and how to use them. this thing simply didn't work right out of the box. while the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from china. loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. i ended up sending it back for a full refund. i don't in anyway blame the seller. they took care of me without a hitch and i would buy from them again...just nothing with the name joyo on it. if you're only buying these based on price i would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Cali review i dont know what all the hype is over this thing. the idea is good and its cute. its for kids and metal heads that want to play screaming guitar but not blow the windows out. how many of these types of noise boxes do we need? not only for the price you need to have a speaker cabinet to go with it. go buy a 20 watt roland cube at least you can play some clean guitar also. or any combo little amp. it's for bedroom use only. you have a external power supply to hook up to it then you need a speaker wire. being light weight as it is also if you move around with your guitar you will pull it off the speaker cabinet and drag it around the stage with you. just get a distortion pedal at least it stays in one spot.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Ian review i have checked this amp out twice, once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 8&#34; version, with both a strat and a les paul, and i am very disappointed in this amp.now admittedly, with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre-amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 5-7, however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones.so, without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing...bottom line: unless you want full on distortion 100% of the time, you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp.... if you are committed to orange (and boy do they make some stunning amps) go check out the dark terror...  overallrating 2 lineend
name John review when i originally went out to place this order, i was planning to order the tc electronics singles voicetone c1 vocal effects processor for its pitch correction function. as i looked over that device and some alternatives, i finally ordered the tc-helicon mic mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects. i ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect - how could tc electronics put out the &#34;mic mechanic&#34; with a pitch correction function that didn't do anything? well, those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has no EFFECT! also, i couldn't see any effect between engaging/disengaging the tone button. i kept the mic mechanic because i like the other effects, but i'm very disappointed in the primary reason i bought it!  overallrating 2 lineend
name Orcatrino review if you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static, non-oscillating, chorus like effect, it's fine for that. as an actual pitch shifter though, this thing is awful. all the pitch shift settings sound like they're 30 cents sharp. this is especially awful sounding when used as an octave effect. i suppose i could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but i did not want to void the warranty so i just returned it. it's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is. i've read the same complaint about their pure octave pedal also. this is really too bad because all the other pedals for mooer seem to be quite good. i own their reecho delay pedal and quite like it and i'm also tempted to get their green mile pedal.if you're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies, this pedal maybe fine for you but i doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory.one minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals. it does not stick to the adhesive on any of the velcro strips i've tried to use.  overallrating 1 lineend

name G. review i have been using this gig bag for the past few months. if i do the math, i probably didn't use it more than 10 times, basically from home to the subway, from the subway to the studio and back, so maybe 20 minutes walk each time. so i used it for about 3 hrs and 20 minutes, mostly carrying it on my shoulders, sometimes by one of the two handles.then the side handle started coming apart: the seam ripped on the side and the handle will eventually fall off if used. it will be ok for a while until the shoulder straps start breaking (which i kind of expect at this point!). meanwhile i'm going to buy another (sturdier) gig bag.save your money and get something better than this.  overallrating 1 lineend

name Vivid review soooo bummed. i simply love the sound on these cans, but the speakers are just too dang close to the surface (not deep enough in the cups) and press down hard on my ears. the max time i can wear them is like an hour, and then i can't wear them for a day or so due to residual pain. i guess if they used thicker pads to deepen the cups, that might help. also, on most of my other phones, the speaker areas have fairly flat surfaces, while this one has the speakers jutting out of the cups and are covered by just one thin nylon sheet. so it's kind of like double trouble. however, these really do have great sound (especially the tight bass clarity). if it weren't for the discomfort factor, i would be using them all the time. as of now, i hardly use them at all. in fact, when i first tested these out, i was ready to hop on the computer and order a couple more. but i'm glad i waited to really give them a more prolonged test. of course, we are all of varying shapes and sizes, ha ha, so they might work for you where they don't for me. if so, you've got a bargain on some great cans. if not, ouch. cheers!  overallrating 2 lineend
name Jon review i love tascam gear, and have used it for nearly 30 years. i was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do. unfortunately, i was disappointed.while the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good, the actual function with the computer left much to be desired. also, the complete lack of a manual with the one i got made it very difficult understand the functions. (sorry, but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 cds of software, how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install cd?)there was a very small quick start guide included, which basically just named the various switches, inputs, and outputs, and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen. i was forced into trial and error to see if i could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode. i could not. i could record and layer multiple tracks (i was using audacity, didn't want to install cubase), but i could not get playback from the previous tracks while i also had live input. now this could have been my computer or audacity, as it is an older win xp machine, but it played back multiple tracks without problem.there was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this, or even hint where one should look, other than going to tascam's web site. i'm sorry, but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive. there should be a complete manual, at least in pdf, included with the product. if i am going to use this to do serious recording, the last thing i want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website, or worse, from \"user community\" threads in some blog.which brings me to another minor complaint - no Linux drivers included. i use mostly linux, with only one windows machine for software which i can't get on linux. i wanted to try the software under wine on linux but was under time constraints.then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware. with a hardware mixer, i can access as many controls as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time. computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time, and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls. the controls on this interface were very fussy, and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react. i found it very tedious, and again, no actual instructions were included to help with that process. with a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case? (yeah, i know, touch screens are cool.)also, software based functions are always limited by your computer and os, and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain.i am old school, and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful. i know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers, and saving space, etc., etc. i value function over fashion, however, and that is what i have always liked about tascam gear: it was supremely functional. this software falls far short of what i expect from tascam, and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable.good mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. the layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first, and takes some time to get comfortable with. old tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording, which was helpful to aspiring recording artists. not so here.i had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars, but sadly, it only rates a 2 (2.5 if i could) for me. come on, tascam, you can do better than this.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Dako review the concept of this guitar stand is great, and i thought it would be perfect for my two telecasters...that is until i get the stands in place and put the guitars in them. the stands have a very deep angle, and from what i could tell, the guitars were sitting about 40 to 45 degrees back.it just looks silly, like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand, or are in a slow-motion fall backwards. it also ends up taking up way too much space, as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes. i ended up returning these stands, but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version.  overallrating 2 lineend
name Edgar review cheap. the best way to describe this stand. it serves it's purpose but spend a few shekels more on a better guitar stand.  overallrating 2 lineend
name guitfiddleblue review the tascam th-2000 headphones are like putting a pair of studio monitors on your ears! they are great! excellent bass response (not muddy at all), tight mids, and clear highs. to boot, they are extremely comfortable as well. the foam fits nicely around your ears, conforming to the contours of your face. they are adjustable, so if you have a huge head you can still wear these. the only drawback that i can see, and i don't really even consider this a negative, is the coiled cord. some people may not like that. all in all these are great headphones - i have listened to all varieties of music with them, monitored recordings with them, etc... excellent! by the way, they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background, making the music come out clearer. kudos to tascam for making such good headphones!may 12, 2014 update these headphones quit working after just a few months of working properly. i have a couple pair of inexpensive behringers that have lasted through more abuse and are still working. what a disappointment!!!  overallrating 2 lineend
name Twiddly review i purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my roland gr55 (which has a flawless basic looper built in, but only 20 seconds record and no undo). i had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that i wouldn't need to carry a power adapter along.the factory battery lasted about 1 hour. the second brand new fresh duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes. i started recording a loop with another (3rd) fresh battery (tested 9.10 v with a multimeter) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording, suggesting that it was faulty. the lights started coming on and off randomly (record/undo/all three together, then off, then undo on, then all three on etc. etc.)the first time i used the jamman xt (with the factory battery) it seemed to be working ok and all i can say is that as a basic looper it sucked.i am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything, so i know it was not my poor technique. the main problem was that it didn't matter how hard i tried (even if i did a manual fade out) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start. this makes the unit useless.also, it is poorly conceived in that, to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws... exposing the delicate printed circuit board.the potential for damage here is very high. also, replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board. to save a few dollars digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible (read inevitable) damage.i have owned quite a few digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one.it's going back to the store where i purchased it.  overallrating 1 lineend
name John review i really wanted to like these, but they're a frickin, lint-catching sticky frickin' mess! they went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a new york minute, have never seen the light of day, and may have been thrown in the garbage. save your money. we use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now.  overallrating 1 lineend
name Kevin review the larger ones sometimes have the neck snap so i thought this might be the answer. the answer is to treat your larger snarks nicer cause this thing on the back of your guitar with no adjustments simple doesn't cut it. i have to move the guitar and crane my neck to see the display. i'm quite disappointed and it sits here with no use. it is cheap though. still to me it was money out the window.  overallrating 2 lineend
name frankp93 review the tension screw adjustment remains the best of any capo i've ever used - and i've tried many over the years. but what was ned smoking when he decided to have the trigger handle and main support stem, including the pick clip and tuner holder, protude outward away from the fingerboard? it's awkward to apply and remove quickly. it's visually distracting for player and audience, and it doesn't add any mechanical benefit to the already excellent tension adjustment.the only possible justification i can come up with is having less to obstruct the fretting hand behind the neck - but even that doesn't fly. regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and, unless you're avoiding playing that first fret (or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position) you're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand. i own the older planet waves tri-action capo and never felt that to be a problem.otherwise the construction of the ns artist capo is superb. the surface is arched, probably between a 10-12 radius that works fine on various strat fingerboards as well as a flatter sg/lp style. it doesn't work as well on the very flat 16 radius of my martin om-1 which is virtually the same as a classical. if i cranked the tension it's possible the rubber would flatten out but i wouldn't risk marring the neck wood.i tried both the pick and tuner clips and they're functional, but to be honest i wouldn't use either - too distracting and i only use tuners to get an initial a, then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments, depending on what they are.the only other capo i've ever used that protudes outward is the kyser with its notorious 'wrought iron fence' design. i have one and, as good as the holding action is, i've never felt comfortable with the design. the older planet waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.to top off the confusion, the picture on the front of the cardboard card the ns artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that's impossible with this capo!  overallrating 2 lineend
name guitfiddleblue review i am a fan of planet waves ns capos, but this new one is not very well designed. the way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards. i find my left hand hitting the lever when i'm in open position. frustrating. it does have a pick holder, which can be handy, and a place to put an ns tuner, which can also be handy. i just think it could have been better designed. i don't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff. i'll stick to my other ns planet waves capo or my old faithful kyser.  overallrating 2 lineend
name P. review i was looking forward to trying these, as i've loved this company's product since day one.but i think they've messed around with the gauge, slapped a meaningless &#34;hd&#34; tag on, and added a few bucks to the price. more profit in someone's pocket for marketing jargon.i have a smaller-bodied guitar, so these should have, by their claim, given me better balance, but imho, the opposite happened. the bottom dropped out, the top end stopped sizzling, and the middle strings totally took over when i strum with a pick.when i play with fingers it's better, but not worth spending more money on than the normal 12s i've been using (which i think i liked a lot better).it's possible that these work great on the taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for (color me skeptical), but i'd say if you're happy with what you have, you need not try these.again, long-time user and big fan, but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly &#34;hd&#34; moniker... no thanks.  overallrating 2 lineend
