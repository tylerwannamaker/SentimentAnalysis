Review: there are a ton of phaser options out there - even from mxr themselves - which makes this issue a bit confusing. i'd owned a phase 90 back in the 80s and wanted another one. a few years ago i didn't have the budget to consider the more expensive mxr versions, so i just got this one.i think it sounds fine. i gigged with it for years without issue. yes, there's a slight volume bump, but i think this is really mostly a midrange hump that will alter your tone and give you some distortion, depending on how your amp is set up. i always use it with a clean tone, and i'm used to it so it's not a big deal.if i were to shop for a phaser today i'd consider some of the other mxr models, as well as versions from other manufacturers which offer a mix knob. a phaser is a very specific sound, but i love it in small doses. for my needs this one works.

Review: was for the old models. the new models have far too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified. i thought i was replacing an old model with the new one, but alas the new is not worthy of a place in my effects chain!i will probably get an eh small stone now, though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too. sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non-musical business men who care only about the bottom line and not enough, if at all about the sound/quality of their products. the capitalists have become too greedy, and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live. god help us!

Review: i have several mxr pedals. every one is superb--except for this phase 90 (the non- review ed here). this phase 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. i did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (look up \"mxr phase 90 mods,\" and \"erik's corner\" will show you how.) i made the \"r28,\" \"c11,\" and \"c12\" modifications. the result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. finally, i tried adjusting the internal trim pot. on no setting could i get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. i spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. no luck. bottom line: if you want a phaser that doesn't add significant distortion, avoid this incarnation of the phase 90.

Review: the mxr phase 90 is a classic stompbox popularized by eddie van halen. at present, i own an mxr phase 90, a boss ph-3 phase shifter, and a line 6 mm4 modulations modeler (with a few phaser patches), so i can compare these three units.the phase 90 has a single \"speed\" control that sets the rate of the phase, so it is simple to use. if there is a single knob, that is a good indicator that the manufacturer feels pretty good about the sound of the unit. in this case, i agree.the mxr phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units. in my opinion, it also gives the best sound within its capabilities, and actually seems to boost the volume slightly. the boss ph-3 gets a slight volume drop but it is workable, and the line 6 mm4 has a volume drop that for me is hard to use on a guitar pedalboard because i usually don't leave modulations on for an entire song, but turn them on/off in different sections (unless its a chorus).of the three, the phase 90 has the least versatility. you can imitate the phase 90 sound on both of the other units (the line 6 mm4 does a slightly better job) and both the ph-3 and mm4 have more sonic possibilities. also, the boss ph-3 will give a lot more spacey extremes than the phase 90 which stays in a \"normal\" range. but again, of the three the mxr phase 90 sounds the best of the three at what it can do.bottom line:(1) a classic pedal at a great price(2) great sound & slight volume boost(3) simple to use(4) limited sonic possibility, \"safe\" or \"normal\" guitar sounds (no crazy extremes)(5) beautiful bright orange color, you can't miss it(6) compact size does not eat up pedalboard space

Review: i will keep this short. the price is unbelievable, it's nice to have three sets in a box and these are the best acoustic strings on the market. that's only my opinion and everyone has one......so many will disagree.i have an regular acoustic and an acoustic electric and strung both with these strings. it made each guitar sound like a 3 thousand dollar guitar. i find that most inexpensive guitars have cheap strings, most can be vastly improved with something as simple as new strings. i really believe in these strings. when i find a good thing, i am hooked and i will not use anything but these on anything acoustic. on a guitar, strings are everything. the tone feel and bend is what's important. these are very light and very easy on the fingers, unlike clunky stock strings on most acoustics. i guess they think you need big, think strings to produce volume....not so. some will disagree saying they break if they're too thin. i would rather have a shorter life with strings, getting a pure beautiful, rich sound than have a long lasting flat string. my thick stock strings were killing my fingers. these are effortless to play and sound so sweet and mellow, just like an acoustic should sound.again, someone will chime in and bash me for saying this...but i would put my inexpensive yamaha up against guitars costing 10 times what i paid. i have no plans of changing brands now i've made the string switch. some say thin strings break easily, but you should change strings often anyway. i can do a string change-over in about 15 minutes on a bad day. it's worth the effort. i don't plan on hammering my acoustic anyway. that's what the fender is for. and it's not that i'm cheap either. i own 18 guitars, 16 of which are electrics. 3 gibson les paul's, 2 fender strats (one american) a couple of dillions (another great find) and some other nice guitars.my acoustic is just an inexpensive yamaha 700 but is a very nice guitar for the money. but after changing the strings it sounds like an expensive martin. it didn't take me long to throw a set of these on my acoustic electric and got the same results.5 stars in my book, more if they'd allow that. there are no other options unless someone gives me a set that blow me away.

Review: low end made in china dreadnaught acoustic - bristol - actually sounds somewhat fantastic in terms of low end resonance and sparkling high end.Here's what i've found. the way you string the guitar makes a difference. with practice i've become more proficient.curve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate. not just a simple bend but kind of bend them over my thumb so they can sort of catch before inserting the bridge pin. then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm.i use a locking pattern on the tuning pegs and keep the string quite tight so it loops tightly around the peg.then i use a microfiber cloth and wipe down each string after each time playing, - use my little finger to hook the cloth under each string and wipe down each length.try to practice for about an hour daily. the tone as i say is pretty darn good. played a high end adirondack, rosewood, name brand and was disappointed that it didn't sound that much better to me.

Review: got the 3 pack and oh what a great difference on me, my guitar, and my sound.i'm a 62 yo newby to guitar!! this proves that easy helps. i have a big baby taylor and when i needed new strings i went to the wrong place, got martins installed -- wow did they make a (bad)diference to me. sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play. my friend said that he uses d'addario and that they make all the difference in the world!! tried them and he was right. i changed my own (on the big baby) and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position (instead of switching the e and b string like the dealer did!) my taylor recommends elixr, but the d'addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers!!

Review: d'addario strings are simply the best!the brightest tone, normal lifespan, fair prices,, and louder than the rest!i have played guitar professionally for over 27 years.these strings are the best all around for tone, clarity, punch and volume.don't be fooled by strings that may last longer or have coating on them just to sacrifice clear tone.one a side note. i hate their new packaging.they used to wrap them individually in paper sleeves. then about a decade ago they started winding them individually, but placed them loosely inside a plastic sealed pouch. now, they wind up two at a time, and place them inside a plastic pouch. arrgh!same great strings and tone, but now you have to unwind them from their &#34;pairs&#34; and lay them out two-at-a-time...kind of aggravating, but no FRIGGIN' way would i ever use another string! - lol!i compared these (and other d'addario's) to other manufacturers...they were much louder and cleaner.don't be an idiot. buy the best all around string and improve your tone immediately.

Review: this is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments. the strings last a long time, in my opinion. they keep their bright look and sound, even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar.i have always liked d'addario's packaging. instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge, d'addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the g is green, the low E is brass (i think - i'm doing this from memory), the high E is silver, and so on. i really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when i have to change a string quickly. it's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great, but the first few times, it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where.d'addario is my favorite string, hands down, after almost 40 years of playing.

Review: i've been playing for 40+ years. i've seen dozens of guitars come and go until i found my 1948 gibson j-45 and i've tried dozens of types of strings. some guitars sound best with phosphor bronze. some sound best with 80/20s. i still have an all koa martin guitar that is so bright that it sounds best with the normally tone-killing elixir polywebs. got a guitar-banjo? try silk-and-steel or silk-and-phosphor. trust me. i've been through my john pearse phase. pyramids? yep. tried 'em. i really liked labellas. the problem was that back when i was using them, they would tarnish in the packaging. i don't know if that's still the case.anyway, the bottom line is that d'addario phosphor bronze are my go to string. they set the baseline for every guitar i've ever owned. (note: that's baseline. in some cases, i've decided something else sounded better.) for many guitars, including my j-45, there's nothing i've found that i've liked better.also worth noting: the string that sounds best depends not only on the particular guitar, but also on the type of pick one uses, the type of music one plays, and the way one approaches the instrument. the string that's best for bluegrass with a hard attack may not be what's best for delicate finger style.bottom line: don't follow leaders. watch the parkin' meters. experiment. but, d'addario pbs are a great place to start.

Review: always buy d'addario strings for my 7 guitars. those strings stay tuned longer and will last me a little longer than others i have tried and believe me when i say that i tried many other types. they have a great rating from other musicians. ....and the price is very affordable. highly recommended by this writer. it is difficult to discuss taste in guitar strings....it is a bit like discussing our likes in food, musicians, movies....etc. we all have our likes and dislikes.....for my taste d'addario ej16-3d is usually the strings i drift back to whenever i buy strings. i like their full sound and their lasting tones.

Review: i have been playing and singing off and on for close to 20 years and currently host an open mic at a local coffee shop. i have used lots of great equipment and mics including the oft mentioned sm57 and sm58. while i did not have either one of those to do an a/b comparison - i did have 2 high-end (over $100 mics) to compare these too. one was an ev and the other a rather costly older peavey. these mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response. the signal was not quite as hot as the ev and peavey, but far more resistant to feedback - even when turned up to match the hotter volumes of the other 2. can't speak to their longevity or reliability yet, but seems sturdy and a nice performing piece of musical equipment. i feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks. great value & highly recommended.

Review: first of all this is not the best microphone ever made. but for what they cost they certainly are more than i expected. i give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even taking the low cost into consideration. they are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $5 for sure. i bought one behringer xm8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go. however, we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech's personal sm-58's are busy at another job. i honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the behringers. at one time alice cooper and his band were using the behringer xm8500's, however they may have moved on now for all i know.these are not Shure sm-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs. they have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the shure's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq'ed correctly. they are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq. it also is if anything more versatile than the sm-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an sm-57 to pick up. it doesn't overload easily, has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the sm-58. it has a reasonably decent blast filter, so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don't have to add a windscreen. another strength of these is durability. my 3 have sustained numerous drops, a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall. no damage at all to any of them! i used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now i just shrug. one weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise, but on the stand handling noise is no issue. mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters. the stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable. if you want sm-58's you need to buy sm-58's. if you want a good all around microphone in the $20 to $40 class then try one of these. no on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the sm-58's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability! i don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price. you can pay more and get less.

Review: bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on youtube. also my cousins use it when practicing before using the condenser microphone before home studio recordings with my focusrite 2i2 interface. my cousin and i can perform live at house parties and events so as to entertain the crowd. so it was something that was necessary. and not waste of money or an unwanted item. also i don't really have to use headphones because it is a dynamic microphone which reduces loop back when using skype or playing video games and talking to your friends, so now i can listen through my speakers.

Review: i am a professional touring and recording artist, omeb, who typically sings through a beta 58. i have recently been very impressed with some of behringer's products. sometimes i will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics. i had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one. at $25 i figured i could chance it! i used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show. the mic was much hotter than the 58, better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies! as far as durability... that is the question, but if you are looking for a great mic that doesn't cost $160 bucks... this is your mic!

Review: i originally was planning on purchasing 2- 3 packs of xm1800s, but after hearing the difference between the xm1800 and the xm8500 it was a no brainer.I was looking to get 5 vocal microphones on a budget for a band that sings loads of harmonies in every song.i really wanted sure sm58&#8217;s, but the budget did not allow it.i normally stay away from behringer due to bad experiences with their consoles and compressors etc., but these microphones were a game changer for me.they have a very full and even tone without any mud or extreme plosives, also an excellent output level to the mixer.i was able to eq them easily for both male and female vocal ranges. i was told by all 5 singers that they could here themselves loud and clear through the monitors.i was also able to get a nice even mix on the front end.i do not know of anything better for the price in live vocal microphones right now.

Review: this is a terrific value for anyone who wants something like the shure sm58 but doesn't want to lay out $100. i bought it myself as a kind of experiment. i'm learning blues harp. i wanted to try out mikes that could be used for a combination of vocals and harmonic playing. for this reason, the mike had to be one that i could cup in my hands but also mount on a stand. while my astatic jt-30 has the great shape and crunchy sound that harp players love, i can't (easily) mount it on a stand and use it for vocals.the spherical receiver makes the xm8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands. the torpedo body mounts easily on my onstage boom mike stand. and the low-impedance output feeds nicely into my guitar amps with no need for preamping or impedance-matching (and no resulting noise or signal loss).the mike isn't perfect, but its low cost and generally excellent construction more than make up for the slight deficiencies. here are a couple of more casual notes:1. the mike in the picture looked bluish to me. what i actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish.2. the product description seems to report a weight of 8.5 ounces. i measured this mike at 10.3 ounces. that gives it a substantial feel although the mike is still a bit lighter than similar dynamic mikes that i've used.3. the mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16,000 hz. bluesmen prefer a cut-off at 10,000 to give a midrange boost, but tweaking can compensate for the extended range on this mike.4. the mike doesn't have an on-off switch, perhaps its only real deficiency. these switches really are very handy.5. in actual use, the mike dosn't seem very susceptible to pops, and there is no hiss.6. the mike comes with a pretty substantial hard-shell carrying case with a molded foam interior that is more than enough protection. i find a smaller zippered case to be more convenient for pacing this mike in a suitcase, but if you are toting a fair amount of equipment around, or storing this at home, then the oversized case should work well.i hope this helps.

Review: first of all, a little amazon 101 - review the product, not the service or the vendor. giving out 1-star ratings because you had a shipping issue or because some third party (like fender) didn't get you the right model is unfortunate, but it has nothing to do with the product itself. all you do is create the impression that this is a poorly-designed product, when exactly the opposite is the case.i have a fender 5-way in my loaded pickguard as part of a squier upgrade. beware that traditional strats are 1 3/4\" thick, where as many bullets and affinity strats are slightly less than that. as such, you might have the bottom of this switch hitting the inside of the guitar. you might need to either live with this or shave/sand out a portion of the interior if that's the case.but the switch itself works great and, really, is quite inexpensive relative to its importance!

Review: it would be improper for me to claim that these fit stratocasters, because i have a stratocaster remake and i drilled new holes for a stratocaster pickguard to get the screws in. what i can say is that the packaging is nice and doesn't seem cheapo (surprised it didn't come all scattered in an envelope or in a ziplock bag) the size of the screws was right, the dark chrome finish on the screws is pretty slick, and it came with more than enough to install a stratocaster pickguard. i'm sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic stratocasters anyways.

Review: used this to replace a dead volume pot in an older strat-type guitar, and it sounds great! the diameter of the threaded portion was a little larger than the original, chinese pot, so i needed a cheap reamer (purchased through amazon) to enlarge the pickguard hole. it's a nice, smooth pot with no scratchiness. nice big lugs to solder to.

Review: good upgrade for my squier deluxe strat. although, note that if your pickguard isn't a fender made brand, the hole in the pickguard maybe a little small. not to worry. all i did was took a drill bit the same size as the &#34;screw&#34; (where the knob goes on, and drilled the pickguard, thus it fitting. over all nice purchase.

Review: i used this on my last stratocaster build. it arrived quickly and was well packaged. it is black and has a kind of white stripe along the edge, so if you are looking for just a solid black pickguard, be aware. the cool thing about this pickguard is that it already has aluminum on the back. i was shielding and star grounding all of my guitars and one of the painful parts was spraying adhesive on the back of pickguards and then putting foil on them and cutting it to fit. these already come with foil, so there is no need to shield them any more than they already are.it fit my body perfectly and i am happy with the purchase.

Review: i picked this up because i wanted to change up the looks of my 3-tone sunburst american standard. the holes lined up perfectly and it was easy to install but that's what you'd expect since this is a genuine fender part. the only concern really is whether or not the color will work on your guitar. at first, it took some getting used to as it really darkened up the look of my strat but i like the way it came out with aged white pick up covers and knobs.

Review: kudos to fender for making an amp like this available at this price point. it has 25 watts of power, a 10 inch speaker, a real spring reverb, and it's a traditional analog circuit without a digital processor. it will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way it's supposed to.the downside is that when i compare this amp to what fender was selling fifteen years ago, the champion 110, it falls a little short. the particle board cabinet is thinner, the speaker is less hefty, and the whole thing feels and sounds a little less substantial. it's obvious that the bean counters really pushed to get this thing as inexpensive as it is, and they also moved production to indonesia from mexico. maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean.all the same, i can still recommend it because it beats the crap out of digital amps and it gives you substantial power and a 10\" speaker and real Fender tone and looks. fender probably figures that players flush with cash will prefer a well-made tube amp or an amp with tons of digital modeling, but i kind of wish they still produced a solid 25 watt analog practice/light gigging amp.

Review: i was buying a pawn shop guitar, when paying they handed me this amp and stated it came with the guitar. i didn't expect to actually use it but what the heck, i could sell it and make a bit of money back. got home to set up my new pawn shop guitar and plugged into the frontman 25 just to see if it worked. i was surprised to find out not only did it work, it sounded very good. i own a deluxe reverb all tube amp and the little frontman 25 had the fender sound. what really was impressive was the reverb, it went from a nice echo to full fledge drippy surf sound. i actually took it to a few small gigs and it did very well, i normally use a blues jr for small gigs but the frontman did a fine job. on some smaller gigs when all i need is a little reverb i just plug straight into the amp and it worked well, plenty of volume and smooth reverb plus it's small and easy on the back. all in all very impressed and have decided to keep it. i would easily pay full retail, it is a nice little amp, might even see if i can squeeze a 12 inch speaker into it!

Review: i actually bought this amp at a pawn shop for $60, but i would have paid the retail price if i had bought it new, with no complaints. for such a small combo, this amp really packs a punch. it is plenty loud, and is just fine for smaller club gigs. however, you could use it in larger venues also, since you generally mic up your amp anyway, and get most of your sound from monitors.anyway, the clean channel is what you would expect from any fender amp, with good tone and crisp reverb. the high gain channel is really fat sounding. i still use distortion pedals, and generally leave it on the clean channel so i can switch back and forth between clean and distortion with ease (not sure if there is a foot switch for the amp, since my pawn shop purchase didnt include one), but without a pedal, the high gain channel performs adequately.for the price, this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion. kind of does away with the need for a half stack, unless you are really gigging frequently at larger venues or outdoors. plus, it is far lighter and easier to transport, lol.

Review: i purchased this for my love of playing guitar. i like blues style and classic rock. this 25 watt amp will get the job done. it is not to be expected as a high quality amp by any means. after a few months of playing the bass knob just blew. so i had no bass control. arrived pretty fast and had no issues as far as tears or dings in the packaging. you just have to mess around with the knobs to get the tone you want. took me like half an hour to get the right amp settings.this amp is rated 75 watts, so technically you could upgrade the speaker to say a 50 watt (into 8 ohm). i would definitely recommend upgrading the speaker to a celestion or jensen. i'd recommend it, but don't buy it if your looking for a really decent tone. it's just a practice amp.

Review: solid construction and well weighted, this stand is perfect for desktop use with height adjustments from 8.5\" to 13\" and a 6\" base; per the measurements given on the box. the locking die-cast steel clutch works well to keep the fit secure. the color is darker than pictured on amazon - black powder coating. there's no tipping or imbalance to worry about with this mic stand, and it's reasonably priced. ( i picked mine up for under ten in the amazon warehouse. it didn't ship with any directions for set-up, which may or may not be the standard packaging.)do take note that this stand has a us standard 5/8\" top. i needed a 5/8\" female to 3/8\" male adapter to get my mic to mount to this stand. there are a few on amazon, but i found the best deal at another retailer online. these are the adapters that i'm talking about:windtech adapter 5/8\" female standard microphone to 3/8\" male. you may not need one if your microphone mount ships with one installed, which can be easily screwed out to then expose the 5/8\" space.overall, i'm very pleased with the fit, finish and construction of this item, and i'm sure it will work very well for my uses. i recommend it to others looking for a stable, sturdy, adjustable desktop microphone stand.

Review: when i found that my usb microphone cannot stand on the tripod that came with it, i was so glad that i bought this stand along with the mic based on all the positive reviews. this stand is basically dead weight. that's exactly what i wanted from a desk stand.

Review: i bought 5 of these for live recording of my band. they adjust easil for most any amplifier height yet stable enough for on stage recoding. i recomend these for anyone that needs a low cost means to place mics on a live stage. features: stable base; good extension; easy hand grip to lock/unlock for adjusting. for me it was a good perchase.

Review: base is heavy and sturdy so your mics won't topple over. but an arm on it and that could be a different story. the action on the height adjust was a little finicky for me but not enough for me to worry about. while i appreciate the weight of the base, i do kind of wish there was a lighter solution to keeping it stable with a heavy mic mounted on an angle.

Review: i was pleasantly surprised of how heavy the base was compared to what i was expecting. the adjustable stand also works great and won't fall on you or anything. i bought this and a mic/boom stand for my samson sp01 shockmount (which the audio-technica condenser mic is on), however its connecting slot is a 3/8in female while this stand has a 5/8in male (same with the mic/boom stand). so just make sure whatever it is you're buying can connect properly with the stand. if not, just buy a cheap (about 6$) adapter like i did.

Review: this is a pretty good way to hold a mic if you want to amplify foot-stomping percussion (traditional to french canadian music). the base is really heavy, which makes it stay in place well, but it's a pain to carry around. also, since buying this i found out that i could just use a shoe to mount a mic by my feet, which would have been a bit cheaper.

Review: i bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well. for only $12 0 it is a steal, the stand is extremely sturdy and pretty heavy. i have used it with multiple mics such as the audio technica 2020 with the samson sp01 shock-mount, a rode k2, a studio projects c1 and a neumann tlm 103. i have not had any problems and the stand is heavy enough to use with basically any mic. i was not going to write a review for this product but i came across another review that stated review ed this to work with a at2020 with a sp01 shockmount. mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what i try. \" this is absolutely FALSE. the samson sp01 shock-mount works perfectly with this stand ( as any shock-mount or mic would, since the threading is a standard size). i just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion. also almost every shock-mount has an adapter in the mount ( where the shock-mount connects to the mic stand) that is slightly smaller than most us mic stands, but this comes out!! all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it from the shock-mount. after the adapter is out the samson sp01 will connect to this stand. i highly recommend this product.

Review: as cheap as these strings were, i am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved.i picked up an old, cheap electric guitar that needed some work. it had been dropped on it's head.after repairing and playing it, it still sounded like crap so i had these strings, they were cheap and i put them on. only took about 5 minutes to restring and was well worth the effort.okay, the guitar (and i am too embarrassed to give the brand) isn't my gibson les paul or my fender american strat, but damn, it sounds good now. if i didn't have so many guitars, i might keep this one but i will probably sell it to make room for another.these were well worth the few dollars i spent on them. honestly, i won't restring my fender with them, i'll use the fender 250 bullets. but these are great for about any electric. with guitars, crappy strings kill it. great strings can make a bad guitar okay, not great.I will continue buying and using these on my lower end guitars but will spend the few extra bucks on my high end guitars.

Review: , because you've already played a set of these. you are off playing different brands and tech just to fine tune things, maybe trying out the latest coating or maybe just deciding that pure nickels have that vintage vibe you're going for.but if you just need to know if ernie ball strings are any good they are. the bigger question for beginners is do i keep the gauge that came on my instrument, (these for gisbsons, super slinkys - pink package - for fenders as a rule of thumb) or do i try something new.in summary, for me these are the safe pick, the strings that i know will work when i just need a good set of strings at a great price. you really can't go wrong with a set of these.

Review: these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings. these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch, ernie ball strings are garbage, the only time i will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh, you can spend 4$ for a set of ernie ball or d'addario every 2 days or you can spend $7 for a set of dr strings and change them once a month, or you can spend 10$ for a set of elixir polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months, it doesn't make sense to use these crappy ernie's unless you are sponsored by eb and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars,

Review: i've tried several different strings on electric, and ernie ball slinkys are the only ones i really trust on all of my guitars. the fact that they also happen to be among the cheapest strings you can find is a nice bonus. but they sound great, and are far less prone to breakage than other brands i have tried. the 9's are super fast and easy to bend, but i've started using 10's more often on my strats, which creates an even more robust sound. they're an industry standard for a reason - you don't need 15 dollar strings!

Review: i typically play d'addario 10's, but i wanted to see what all the fuss was about with these. well i gotta say, i'm not stricken with disbelief at these, but they are very nice. overall i would say that they feel about the same as my d'addario strings, but if the price is right i wouldn't mind a substitution every now and again. they do bend very nicely, obviously your guitar's scale length and your ability to bend strings may vary.

Review: i've been playing guitar for 25 years and when i was first getting started for what ever reason i hated super slinkys with a passion. i was a fender or d'addario guy and eb ss were beneath me.fast forward to a few weeks ago when i got a used jackson with dead stings on it. i wasn't sure i was going to keep it but wanted to give it a chance with new strings. all of my guitars are setup with 10s but the jackson needed 9's and i didn't want to bother setting up the floyd rose for 10's on a guitar i might not keep.I came onto amazon to find some inexpensive prime eligible strings and these came up, wth i'll give them a shot.wow these are some good sounding strings. i have no idea why i didn't like them before, maybe my hearing is much worse than before? who knows. anyway i ended up keeping the guitar, a jackson dk2m.

Review: these strings are great for all sorts of playing styles. i bought a set of 9's and 10's and i also have some d'addario 11's. the 9's are super slinky just like the name says. they're great for quick movement around the fret board. my only complaint is that they are at times too thin sounding. i play a lot of rock, and sometimes these just don't pack a punch like the 10's or 11's do. all in all though, these are great strings, and i will definitely continue to buy ernie ball, i'll probably opt for 10's or 11's though.

Review: this little music stand folds up small enough (after some disassembly) to fit in a pouch less than 2 feet tall and 2 inches wide. once assembled, it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books. the height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you're standing, seated on a stool or in a chair. the angle of the tray is not adjustable. the legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it, so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location. but for a portable stand, it's hard to find fault with this one, especially given the low cost.

Review: this stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging. if you need a boom, simply add anon stage msa7040tb adjustable microphone boom, blackand you're good to go.in addition to being indestructible, this stand takes up far less stage (or studio) real estate than a tripod type stand like theon stage stands ms7701 tripod boom microphone stand. and despite the relatively small size of the base, it is far more stable than the tripod stands. admittedly, this stand is a great deal heavier, so if weight is an issue you may not like this type.even with a boom fully extended i have found this stand to be stable. for outside use in fair breezes this stand remains upright, which is not always the case with the tripod types. moreover, there are no legs to break (i have lost one tripod stand to that problem.)if you transport your gear often, and especially if you play outside (or inside on cramped stages) this stand is the best choice in my opinion.

Review: there a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today. sure, some are said to be the best at this or that, but for me the rat is the one that does it all. and at a great price to boot. this pedal is not new to me. i've had a few of them in the past, but the rat 2 is just a great as the older \"vintage\" models. goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a tube screamer, to a near fuzztone, with some warm, smooth creamy tones in between. remarkable. no other distortion pedal can do it as well. i've been playing for 5 decades and have had more than my share of them. but the rat delivers. no joke. it just does it all, and well.the filter (tone) is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise. that might thow a few folks off, but it's a little thing really. the filter is the core of it's tone and the distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion. by going higher with the distortion control, the volume only goes up a little. that's great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit, the volume won't go through the roof.100% silent switching. no hum. no buzz. and no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit. flawless comes to mind here. easy to set up. strong as a tiger tank. and just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of 6 or 8 knobs for you to mess with. and the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the rats of the past. kinda cool if you ask me.if one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues, get yourself a rat. if you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a \"boo-teek\" pedal that sits in the rat's shadow, buy that high dollar unit and you can at least \"look good\" while you play. but your tone will still stink. its up to you. me? its a no brainer. i go with the rat....

Review: i have one one these from the 80's back home, and when i was looking for a new peddle, i found this was still the best around. i remember searching for the right peddle back in the 80's and going through dozens of them before settling on the rat. and it's exactly the same... simple, sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain. i run it through all manner of amps - including marshalls, vox, and even crate, both tube and transistor, and with a few quick easy adjustments i get exactly what i'm looking for no matter the box.i'm an old school player - meaning i want my sound to come from the guitar and amp instead of processors. this is just an enhancement to my sound, and not the basis of it... though i expect anyone will get what they want from this baby.

Review: this pedal is exactly what i have been looking for since three years ago when i started performing. the distortion on this is deep, has long sustain, and has a nice tone to it that the classic boss ds-1 pedal does not have. it's perfect for a great sound, from heavy rhythm guitar chugging to fat, bruising solos.i love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since i got it.however, word of fair warning: the pedal itself uses a +9v power charge rather than the typical guitar f/x pedal -9v (barrel jack. look at the power supply of a boss pedal to see what i am talking about. this proco rat pedal does not use that). if you buy this pedal, you will have to do one of four things:1) buy the power supply made specifically for this pedal.2) consistently use and replace batteries.3) find a converter from barrel jack to 3.5mm jack.4) be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself.other than the above, excellent pedal!

Review: after playing digital equipment for years i recently got into analog (pun intended) starting with an overdrive pedal.i had always heard a lot about the rat and i wanted to try it out.i played a boss ds1 at a store and thought it was a decent distortion but found it too trebly and thin.the rat with all the knobs on 12 oclock sounds like a great rock amp. like a perfect marshall but with more organic-ness. it really has its own tone i must add. fat, thick, smooth and saturated. it responds to picking very well and organically.as you move the distortion knob higher, the sounds gets more and more animal. very thick and \"furry\". the tone filter knob also is a very strong influence on the sound. with lower settngs the tone becomes more trebly and smooth and with higher settings it gets closer to fuzz. very nice.A nice pedal to have to be sure.

Review: i've owned over 3 dozen dirt boxes over the years, and i just love the rat. it makes my tube halfstack sing, and my practice amp sound like a big amp.its great as a stand alone distortion, running on a clean amp. it can get everything from that perfect bluesy grit to roaring sludge (just max out the distortion and use your neck pickup on an lp to sound exactly like king buzzo of the melvins) and everything inbetween.it can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory. case in point, my buddy has an old peavy stack from the 70's in his garage. its a solid state head on top of a vertical cab of two 14\" speakers. on its own, you can use the gain and distortion knobs present on the amp to get a decent sound, but with his les paul it still sounded oddly dark. we put the rat in front of it and with some fiddling got that perfect ac/dc style overdrive out of it.i think the main reason i love the rat so much is not only the great tone and its sheer indestructability, but the filter knob. normal tone knobs allow you to focus more on bass or treble, but usually if you boost one, you cut the other. the filter is more of a high end roll off, you can darken or brighten your tone accordingly, but when you do go brighter, you still have the same bottom end. it doesn't cut the bass out. so even with a more treble heavy sound, you still have a fuller rounder tone, it doesn't thin out so much.its really an excellent pedal. i've heard that some claim you have to get an older one with the lm308 chip to really get \"the sound\" but that's a myth. look on a few guitar forums or on youtube for plenty of tests and testimony showing the fact that the new ones do indeed sound the same as the old ones. a rat is a rat, whether they're coming from china or the usa.p.s. mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark. so i dunno what that other guy was complaining about.

Review: as far as tried and true distortion pedals go, this is really just average. the filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion. compared to other distortion pedals, it really fails in this regard. however, if used as a fuzz pedal instead, it truly shines, since this is really what it is. does it have distortion? yes. is it valuable as such? not in my opinion. it isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that. another gripe i have is the 9 volt slot. most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply. not so with this pedal. you are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries, which sux imo, especially since i run all my pedals off an adapter chain.anyways, while this is fun to play with, you should definitely consider the sound you are going for. if you prefer to play a more grungy or 70's era metal, then this will work for you. for more crisp sound, you should look elsewhere. imo

Review: i love adding channels to amps, and that is exactly what this pedal does. it helped me create a separate fuzz/distortion channel that makes my rig extra versatile. it's built to last and solid as a rock. i love the different dirt it gets combined with my mxr carbon copy nooned across the board. insanity! i love my main rig distortion, but this definitely helps add depth, and doesn't tank my tone. last distortion pedal you'll ever need.

Review: casual, part time guitar player here. i use it on the back of the headstock to always have picks with the guitar when i pick it up. the one i received was all black, not brown on the sides as in the photo. no matter. it is a bit larger than you might expect from the photo. i dont know if that is to accommodate a larger size of pick, or what. it is big enough that 'normal' electric guitar picks can almost turn sideways in it. it also likes to give you more than one pick at a time. both of which i would say make it not a contender for fast pick replacement, like in the middle of a song. but it is good for keeping them all in one place, either on the guitar or a desk, toolbox, etc.nice little item for $2

Review: this is the best cleaning product i've ever used. not only do i use it on my maple and rosewood fretboards, but i also use it on the headstock if it's unfinished and on the unfinished body of my ukulele. what it does is it restores the wood in a way that it gives it a much more brilliant, beautiful and lively tone. really brings out the beauty of true wood. now every fretboard and unfinished bit of wood on my guitars looks beautiful and brand new. application method is also very useful. i don't know why there is a strict warning saying not to use it on maple fretboards; i put it on my stratocaster's maple fretboard and it looks beautiful. the only thing it did differently was it made the fretboard a good shade darker. i also must add that the stuff has a very wonderful lemony smell (nowhere near overpowering), and it does clean off a lot of dirt in conjunction to hydrating and livening the wood. great stuff. go ahead and buy it.

Review: i was hoping the lemon oil would be what i needed to get that crud off some of my guitar fingerboards but, it's not very good at that. i suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry. once clean, the lemon oil does a good job of sealing the wood - even where years of playing have taken their toll. it's a good finish but, not the place to start. the product is not meant to be used on maple. don't know why but, not an issue since most of my instruments are rosewood or other dark, exotic woods. so far, so good.

Review: it's oil....what more do you want?turn upside down, squeeze hard, use your &#34;man&#34; level strength and soon the tip will darken, apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion. immediately wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away. let sit for a few hours then dry rest of the way rubbing with cloth.it's okay to soak the wood as long as it's momentary. don't saturate the fretboard and walk away, wood absorbs oil, too much oil absorbed = fretboard wood becoming swollen and buckling, losing shape and flatness. not a good situation.lemon oil isn't like other oils, it isn't very slippery and kind of makes things grabby. it's oil but it actually works more like a solvent, cleaning things and making them sqeaky clean....like your frets...hint hint.just be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you re-string and you'll be a happy camper.

Review: i love this stuff. i've tried many fretboard and string cleaners but this one works the best. and in case you are wondering, it comes with a cloth cap attached to the bottle under the twist off cap so all you have to do is turn the bottle upside down and clean away. you may need an additional cloth in the beginning to wipe off the excess liquid because the bottle is full when you first get it (of course). i highly recommend this product.

Review: this will make your fretboard smile! it takes a dry, faded, fretboard and makes it look like new. a few dabs goes a long way so this 4 ounce bottle should last you a long time. if your fretboard is really dry & faded, apply heavily and allow it soak in. continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry. i was amazed at how this made a dull & faded 40 year old fender fretboard came back to life.

Review: works great - keeps all my fretboards looking great. even though i change strings frequently on my twelve (12) acoustic electric guitars this bottle will last forever. i play hard for several hours almost every day and i'm always amazed at the &#34;crud&#34; that accumulates on the fretboards. (guess i'll have to stop eating cheetos while i'm playing - just kidding...) this oil breaks down the &#34;crud&#34; and restores the look of the fretboard to new condition. no issues / no problems only positive things to say about the oil...

Review: lemon has been known for quite some generations to be a good cleaning solvent because of its acidic nature and this certainly does the job. as the label warns: do not to use on maple-wood frets (mostly fender strats) due to the softer & lighter quality. it is only for the harder, darker woods like mahogany (which i have) or ebony (high quality - i.e. expensive - used best for fretless). the solution is perfect, but the applicator (attached to the neck of the bottle) could be better. i would rather take the neck applicator out and apply lightly using a 100% cotton cloth.this solution has been made specifically for use on guitars, though i think you could find a similar lemon oil cleaner cheaper at local stores. it's only 4-oz, but what little is used each time, this bottle should last the guitar owner his/her life.

Review: this is a lemon oil used for cleaning and conditioning the rosewood fingerboards of guitars. this only gets done once a year on the average guitar, so if you're like me, this one bottle will supply you for many lifetimes. other than that, it is what it is and does what it says. the applicator contains a dispensing valve so push down hard to open it when you want the oil to flow.the label says not to use this product on maple fingerboards. doesn't say why, but my guess is it will discolor them, so be forewarned.

Review: but the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio. there's a slight hiss too. but i enjoyed listening to it while playing. and when you attach the headphones it works great. amazine that it works off a 9v battery. yes, you have to lug around a guitar cord, but what do you expect. i went all out and got a roland cube which should deliver a higher quality sound and has many sound effects. but that costs 2x or more as much. i am in the process of returning it. look at the picture of it next to a coke can. that's what it looks like. some people complained that the handle doesn't work. who cares. the tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too. but that's sort of what you're getting.

Review: for the price you can't really beat this little amp, the only down fall is that at full volume with the gain up, the little speaker gets kinda muddy, but for a bright clean tone it works well, the tone controle offers a well rounded array of tones and the gain is great from a blues to metal tone of gain.the headphones input just is handy when wanting to play into the wee hours of the morning without disturbing anybody, but with the headphones hooked up you can really hear the digital sound it makes... but for the money it's a great buy

Review: i play bass in a lot of different environments, and i never know what to expect before i show up. if i am playing a venue where i can use my head and 4x12 combo i know i'll have great tone. if i am going direct into the board i am at the mercy of the house equipment and engineer. this unit gives me ;the ability to still go direct, but allows me to tweak the signal for maximum warmth. i suppose you could look at this like an effects stomp box but it is really so much more. if you play at church and are tired of hearing the life sucked out of your bass you should give this a try. i love it.

Review: di bass is the worst. just really, really awful. every ordinary di box i've tried yields this thin, cheap treble sound that does not present my bass in its most flattering light. so when i started playing live weekly, i just hauled my bass amp around to each gig, because it was out of the question that i would rely on a weird sounding di box to carry the day.i live in phoenix. i made it through about two months of lugging a monstrous bass amp across town in 115 degree weather before i decided there had to be another way.when i first got this pedal, i would run it parallel with the amp, terrified to rely entirely on this little box for my sound. after a few performances, i let go and left the amp at home. the bass attack pedal did not disappoint. ever since, i just bring a bass and this pedal. running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound. i don't miss the amp at all.i did spend an entire evening the night this pedal arrived, just tweaking knobs until it was perfect. you'll want to dial in exactly the right sound for your bass, and some of the settings i tried were less than ideal for my instrument. but once i got it locked in, i've never touched the knobs again. i just plug in and everything sounds magical.

Review: i rated it at 5 stars because 5 stars means &#34;i love it&#34; in amazon's selection of things . i do love it. in fact i think it is better than my sans amp bass di which costs more. don't get me wrong, the sans amp is still great. i just find this easier to dial in, it is durable and seems a bit more lively sounding than the previously mentioned preamp. the only down side is that it doesn't come with an ac power adapter. that isn't a problem for me since i have many power options on my pedal boards. this takes the standard negative polarity center like boss pedals.if you have been playing bass for a while, you know that no matter how good your bass rig is, you can make it better by putting a decent tone shaping booster in front of your amp...that being said............i am in my 50s and i play mostly guitar hero music like robin trower, srv, hendrix, yes, rush, and lots of blues and southern rock etc etc............. the fun old rock n roll stuff.like the sans amp, putting this in front of any bass amp only makes the bass sound better. you can easily get the live chris squier or geddy lee sound. the older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound is simple. the tone that i love to dial in is that old 3 piece rock band sound from years past. think of mel from grand funk railroad or old james gang in the joe walsh days, johnny winter, and the cream........ that over driven cranked ampeg or fender tube bass amp sound that filled in exceptionally well in a 3 piece power band.i am running this into an ampeg bass combo and i have run it directly to the front of house sound system and the sound is fabulous. playing bass is a side gig for me since i am mainly a lead guitarist........ i let my bassist try it (he also uses a sans amp bass di at our gigs) and he immediately went online and purchased one.he is another cool use for this pedal. if you are a guitarist, put it in front of your guitar amp. the punch and power that you add to your sound is incredible. try it.

Review: this thing sounds great! i run two outputs from this into my daw (reaper), so that i can have a direct di for reamping and the regular tone from the hartke's preamp for an overall bass tone. the general sound of it is warm with plenty of low end, and the \"shape\" control is pretty cool for adding a little bit of distortion/break-up for layering. it's easy to reamp with, so layering the unshaped hartke tone + another track of shaped \"gritty\" tone can get you some seriously solid sounding bass tones in a mix - especially for higher gain metal playing.awesome unit for the price, very happy with it.

Review: i'm using this as a di box for recording. it does some compression, overdrive, eq'ing, notch eq'ing, and excite-ing all in one pedal. so compared to the original bass signal, you get this clear, deep, punchy sound that fits right into a mix.the bass attack sounds a lot like a sansamp bass driver but at 1/3 the price. one difference is that it has an additional \"shape\" knob, which is a lot like the isf knob on blackstar products, and is a notch filter. the other difference is that the sansamp uses tougher chassis and components, so would last longer for the gigging musician. but don't take me wrong, the bass attack uses a solid metal chassis and doesn't feel cheap at all.the harmonics knob adds some overdrive, and gets kind of farty when turned up 100% but sounds pretty good at 75-90%. it doesn't do that high gain super gritty/fizzy distortion though, for that you could connect a distortion pedal to the parallel output, or duplicate the track in your daw and add a distortion plugin.this pedal is very versatile. i found that the shape knob is indispensable; it takes the place of a mid control. for example, by notching (reducing) the boomy 60-130 hz region and turning up the level, you get plenty more mids. the treble and bright control seem very similar to each other, one seems to amplify the 4k region, the other the 5k but that's just an estimate. by keeping both of those around 10 o'clock and the shape control beneath 115 hz, i can get a solid, deep, yet mid-full sound for a metal mix. thus anyone who thinks this pedal is all bass and treble and no mids, ought to try settings along those lines.another good feature is that this pedal can run on 48v phantom power. as in, no adapter or battery needed when recording direct or running to a mixer. in conclusion, for recording, you can duplicate the sansamp sound that you hear on a lot of albums using the bass attack, and tweak it further via the shape control. and yes, the various button pushes get you four different sounds total, but i prefer having both buttons on. then in my daw i only throw on an extra compressor and it sounds great. this pedal is a steal for no frills bass di recording.

Review: i normally buy d'addario strings here. i buy the 11 or 12 strings. this is my first time playing ernie ball since i first began learning. when i first started on guitar i put 09 electric ernie ball on my acoustic so i could handle the pain and keep learning. then i went to d'addario strings. i wanted to try these since the under $5 price is good.they sound nice. they don't sound as crisp as the d'addario strings. they sound more mellow and not as bold. they are 80/20 and i prefer those to the other strings out there. i can't say i love them or i hate them. i will probably stick with d'addario since i don't find any difference in them. i bought some other ernie ball strings on amazon that i will try soon. for the price i would buy these strings at least once to test out and see how you feel about them. i don't think they sound bad and if they do, it did not cost much to test them. enjoy

Review: i have used ernie ball strings on my les paul for quite a while, slinkys mostly. i recently bought a yamaha fg700s and quickly found that the high E string had a very \"tinny\" tone. i searched the net to see if this was comon with this model, alas i found that it is.so i decided to try some different strings to see if it would help. i ordered a set of earthwood lights and installed them last night.wow, what a difference. first the tone is much softer on the e string, second the action feels much more comfortable on strings 1 thru 3. the strings that came on the guitar were yamaha light strings but they were very stiff, especially the b string. after a hour of playing with the earthwood strings last night they were much more enjoyable, both tonally and physically. not sure how they will last, time will tell.good strings i would recommend them.

Review: they were a little too much for the squier bullet i put them on, even with the truss rod maxed out they bowed the neck.while i had em on though they played well and bent relatively easy for their thickness. more metal moving over a guitar pickup = hotter sound, more gain, and on a stratocaster more glass and bell like tones.i've used ernie ball's slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades. they never break, they stay in tune after stretching, and they sound great. lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound.fun fact: get yourself a mandrel for sizing rings and you can turn your old guitar strings into custom made jewlery. there is something to be said for giving a pretty ring that used to make a pretty sound ringing out of your amplifier. :) a little silver lead free solder to hold several windings together and then buffed and they look excellent. :)

Review: i have tried a few types of strings on my p90 epiphone les paul, and i find these ernie ball power slinky 11's to have a lot of power and punch to them, as advertised, and give me the nice tone i was looking for. the power and thick sound is due to these strings being a heavier gauge than the strings that usually come with a guitar. it will take a little more finger strength to play these but it is worth getting used to. these strings work well with the many different types of rock i play, and will work even fine with drop c tuning. they have also been as durable as strings get and do not lose their tone for quite some time. i prefer these power slinkys over d'addario xl 10's, over regular slinky 10's (which i used to like until i tried these), and even prefer them over the more expensive full nickel rock 'n roll slinky 10's which surprisingly sounded boring when compared to the energy the power slinkys give you. i would say the power slinkys give off a sufficiently bright sound, but not excessively bright, and i would recommend them to anyone thinking about giving them a try.

Review: i bought these to beef up the bottom end of a telecaster that came from the factory with a set of fender 9's that topped out at 42 on the low E, which is just too small for good twangy bass. i've been using them for a few months now and haven't broken one even though i can bend the high E to touch the d string. i use d'addarios on my other guitars but tried these ernie balls just for the hybrid mix and there isn't a whole lot of difference. d'addario sells a similar set called exl125 so maybe i'll try those next but for now these are good.

Review: i finally bought into the monster cable hype; albeit with a 6' practice cable. i can honestly tell a difference. that difference being silence; no abnormal hissing or popping that i got from my other, cheaper cables. this isn't the top-of-the-line monster, but still a step up from what i'd been using. i'll definitely upgrade my longer cables to monster, and may even see how the expensive one sounds (a short one 1st, of course!).

Review: i gave it a 5 star because monster cables come with a life time warranty depending on how it breaks, but this 6ft cord is taller than i am which means it's about 6' 2&#34; tall... it's a great product for the money exspecially if it's just being used for a late night practice with a small amp or for a pedal connection into your amp, it's short and sturdy enough to take the roughest beatings and still keep working

Review: i'm a keyboard player, and in the past i had been spending $40-$60 for monster's \"delegated\" keyboard cables. but suddenly one shorted out on me after only several months use, causing me to question the \"monster mystique.\" i began to compare the monster keyboard cables with cheap, \"off-brand\" guitar cables and couldn't hear any difference. no question it's a well-made, trustworthy (but not indestructible or infallible) cable, but i'm no longer committed to it at any price. however, at amazon's current \"value\" price for this particular monster cable, it's a no-brainer. moreover, i no longer have hesitations about purchasing a cable that doesn't say \"piano\" or \"keyboard\" on it. (one of my monster keyboard cables even came with one end designated for the amp and the other for the instrument--but it was hard to see which was which in a dimly lit club.)as for length, 6 feet is ideal if you're playing through your own amp (my preference). if you're plugging into a board or p.a. system, you'll want anywhere from 12 feet to 25 feet.

Review: i play guitar. i bought one each of the various thicknesses of these picks a few years ago. they're very interesting. these are soft rubber with a little bit of give, so they really soften your attack and cut higher frequencies, similar to using your thumb, but not exactly. i still pull one of these out every once in awhile. in certain applications, getting a particular sound for a song, say, these could be exactly what you're looking for. overall these are well made, and the ones i bought will probably last me forever, but these would never work for me as a main pick. i'm glad i tried them though, as i have nothing else remotely like them.

Review: update 9/7/12 ok i've been using these for a few weeks now, and i have to say i keep going back to them. they make the notes sound like bells. it's holding up better than i expected (i am a relatively soft player) and i'm adjusting to the 'stickiness' mentioned below. i am liking these more and more as time goes by. glad i tried these! original review recently i got the itch to try different 'unique' picks... these, the dunlop primetones, felt picks, metal picks, etc. i get annoyed by the plastic clicking sound from regular thin picks.these are interesting. they perform quietly and give a more mellow tone. they do however stick to the strings and it becomes difficult to use them, will need some getting used to. i wish i had ordered the hard version rather than the medium, as these are a bit softer than i was hoping.probably won't be a daily driver, but interesting none the less.

Review: i usually play my jazz bass fingerstyle, but there are songs where i prefer a pick, especially when i need speed and accuracy. until i found the hard wedgie rubber pick, i used a heavy fender pick, but didn't like the sharp pick sound very much.I bought a set of soft, medium and hard wedgie picks to try out and i'm really happy with the results. i greatly prefer the soft wedgie on the uke, i like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard wedgie's really nice for my jazz bass. i still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars, but the wedgie's are fantastic for when i need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments. i prefer the 3.1mm wedgie picks since the 5mm picks feel a bit too thick for my tastes, but that's entirely subjective.i'd love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday, but it still works very well for me.

Review: playing an acoustic ukulele with all nylon strings, i've preferred just to strum using my fingers because \"traditional\" plastic picks are just too harsh and loud. even felt picks are too harsh (not to mention the dust/shedding they do).the wedgie is exactly what i've been looking for. harder than my thumb, softer than plastic or felt, the 3.1mm hard rubber wedgie is the goldilocks pick; right in the butter zone.i tried the \"soft\" and \"medium\" wedgies, but both were just too soft. the soft wedgie over-grabs the strings and winds up dragging and producing a dull tone. the medium is better, but is still too dull and the action is a bit too soft.but the hard wedgie is the clear winner. i get great volume and tone without the harsh twang of plastic on nylon strings.the only negatives i've found are:1. they can leave skid marks on your pick guard. no big deal, as it wipes right off.2. they break down faster than i'd like. of course, that could just be my expectations.still, if you're looking a softer-than-plastic pick, this is the one to get. no pick noise, just strings. i couldn't be happier.

Review: i bought one of each soft, medium and hard wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the hard is as soft as the soft. they felt exactly the same in fact. the medium was the hardest out of the bunch.packaging error? i have no idea. the fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. so check with what you get.sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.there is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that i do not think it is idea for strumming.the only reason i can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead.

Review: i've tried all 3 types of these, and they're pretty much as-advertised. i don't really find a huge difference in tone between the relative hardnesses of the rubber, but it is there to a small degree. to me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic. well, they don't sound bad, but if you then switch to a normal pick you'll notice the upper and upper-mid harmonics that are being de-emphasized by the duller attack. it doesn't sound bad, and in certain applications it would be fine. i wouldn't want it to be my everyday acoustic tone, though.they fare much better with electric guitar, where the difference in attack can be less notable, but you'll still notice the loss of some \"sparkle\". but for the most part i found the sound very agreeable and useable. the pick tends to catch on the strings a bit - there's more friction, of course - but it's just something to get used to.the bottom line: i like these, and they'll probably last me almost forever, but i don't really see them becoming my go-to picks. i like the thickness and the feel (they won't slip out of your hand while playing) but the loss in high end is just enough that i don't think i want to limit myself in that way, except for certain situations. i tend to switch back and forth between a pick and fingers anyway, so i already get a sound similar to this by using my fingers. worth a try, though, and you just might find a keeper if you need to tame an amp or guitar that's just a bit too bright. you know, at higher volumes, too, it's easy for the high frequencies to be emphasized, and these might work better in a live setting where you've got your amp cranked up.

Review: this is a great pick for all those that use picks, but need a softer sound occasionally. much easier than getting your fingers all tangled up. the only negative is the way they seem to be packed here. they come in three colors and the colors stand for soft, medium, hard. they also come in 3 and 5mm which is the size of the grip thickness (where you grip the pick.) the white is soft, the medium grey is medium, and the dark grey is hard. i use the white and medium grey in 3.1mm and find that easy to adjust too. they are soft and they do wear fairly quickly, but you just keep playing them or do a little cutting to sharpen them back up. you get a nice soft tone and, just like using any other plectrum, you develop a picking style to get various tones (double bass, acoustic, finger style, etc. i use the soft picks for a smooth tone, and the medium pick for a deep jazzy sound (think motown.) i never leave home without at least three of each in my gig bag.for a real trip, if you are able to finger pick, try out the jam cat pick holder sold here. it is so easy to switch from finger to pick in an instant and it is always there when you need to rock it up a bit.

Review: i like the medium version of these picks a lot, & i just ordered some hard ones at the 3.1mm thickness--which is pretty thick, by the way. so only plan on using these on basses and acoustic guitars unless your electric has an unusually wide neck and heavy strings. these soft ones have too much give in my opinion, which makes them more difficult to handle--it's great that they eliminate pick noise, but these softer ones want to cling to the strings and require the player to make too many adjustments. my verdict: go with medium or hard version.

Review: i purchased a 3 pack of the soft rubber wedgie's as an add-on to a larger order. as such, i found them to be a reasonable value. however, i'm not sure how long these will last on my steel string acoustic. i think these picks would be fantastic for classical or any other nylon string guitar or \"uke\". they are very grippy and have a slight concavity to them on one side for additional comfort.i love the very soft warm sound they provide. i use them mostly late at night when i can't sleep and want to play, but the rest of the family is still sleeping. not quite as effective on the e, a, and d steel strings but certainly playable. not so great for strumming, but fun to pick individual chords. thanks.spo

Review: ok, it was cheap (nine bucks at the time), the design looked good and sensible, and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need. i bought it without hesitation. however(!), once hooked up, i was very surprised how flimsy it is. i have a 13\" gooseneck, a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it. at the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand. obviously, any small bump into the stand will once again set this off. using it at home, i've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful, but obviously this unit is far from ideal. since then, i've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand, and though i haven't really put through its paces yet, this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable, and only costs a few bucks more (on stage msa9508 posi-lok sidemount boom). for anyone considering this product, i highly recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the on stage msa9508 posi-lok sidemount boom. you will be far far happier.cheers!

Review: it does what it is suppose to, cut vibration and well i might add. much better than a standard clip on a mic. this one is not going to break if you take the mic on and off, since it's rubber. if it does break, has a lifetime warranty. had a shure sm58 on a table, on a stand in this clip, pounded on the table, only picked up the tap sound my hand has making, and no sub harmonics vibrating though the table. moved the mic off axis, pounded again, absolutely no noise. can't ask for more than that.

Review: i was upset when i bought the mic stand and didn't know the clip didn't come with it.so i had to order a clip later.nevertheless, it has good design to dampen the shocks.it is also rubber in construction so it won't crack like the other low quality clips.it is a bit big for the cabled mics (so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag), but for wireless mics, it is good.i would recommend it.

Review: i purchased this for use with a sennheiser e825-s microphone and the bestselling on stage boom microphone stand. the mount has exceeded my expectations. the fit for the stand is perfect, with the mount pivoted so that the mike can be adjusted up or down. the part actually holding the mike is flexible and rubbery, making it very easy to slide the mike and its cord in and out. a screw tightens te pivot if this needs to be fixed more firmly in place. all in all, a very worthwhile and economical purchase.

Review: i purchased this to interface the xlr plug on a sennheiser e825-s mike with the input on guitar amplifiers. it seemed to work very well in this role. it was well-constructed, with all the connecting points working precisely and securely.somewhat after the fact, i started worrying about whether i should have instead gotten an adapter with impedance matching capabilities. i'm hardly a professional technician in this area, but i did do enough research to figure out a good working answer: lo-z (low impedance) microphones (say, 1,000 ohms or less) generally do not have to be matched to solid-state amplifiers, which are likely to have hi-z (high impedance) inputs in the range of 10,000 ohms. these amplifiers ae generally designed to accommodate a 10:1 impedance ratio (load to source). i calculated the signal loss of such an arrangement in the range of 0.83 decibels, which is incidental.this corresponds to what my ears tell me: this adapter works just fine without impedance matching. i can't say for sure whether that also holds for tube amps but will update my review if i have a chance to find out.update: since i wrote my initial review, i have discovered that pyle seems to have a problem securing its connectors properly with set screws. if you purchase this item, i suggest you have a micro-screwdriver set handy so you can tighten everything up before you discover to your chagrin that a loose set screw has gone missing or caused your connector to fall apart.

Review: these little mic connectors are just what the doctor ordered, allowing me to spare wear and tear on my systems mic jacks; i simply unplug the cord from the adapter instead. and, they produce no audible hum into the circuit. they are unbalanced jacks, though (note the single black band at the end of the plug,) so if you need balanced jacks for your system (those with two black bands,) make sure you take that into account before ordering. by the way, i have both and there is no audible difference whether singing or recording. just saying...

Review: fist off, guitar center had this for 29 bucks!!! i know right. it was in front of the tag for this (30 bucks) and the sp-1 for 14.99 so i got it, but it was in the wrong spot, i went, got the price tag, and after minimal drama, they gave it to me for the price they had it incorrectly listed.that said, the pedal is great. the problem people have with the pedal, as i can see it, if they say it or not, is that some sounds don't have the same sustain as a piano or synth sound. it has been fun playing organ sounds and trying to \"pump the pedal\" to keep sustain and not \"wash out\" the tone. this thing is great and if anyone needs a pedal for their synth (i have a casio wtk-4200 i believe), it is as good as you need. as said, any over-sustaining is when you need to learn when and where to release and start the sustain again, which is the true art of it. 30 bucks? robbers.

Review: i've used this pedal with a casio px200 keyboard for about 6 weeks now.pros:-sturdy construction (compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards).-polarity switch - i was using a yamaha fc4 with an older keyboard, but the fc4 does not work properly with the casio keyboards. it's a tip-negative polarity, and the privia requires a tip-positive polarity. so the piano would operate in reverse (sustain on until the pedal is depressed). thankfully, the sp-2 has a switch on the bottom that can switch and accomodate any keyboard.-cord is long enough (6')con:-build quality is slightly less than the fc4. the fc4 has a smooth action (made in japan), but the sp-2 had some problems with the metal spring squeaking. some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking.the sp-2 also comes with a plastic cap if you prefer to cover the metal pedal. overall, it is a solid product and almost a necessary upgrade for the plastic footswitch pedals.

Review: i recently picked up a used casio privia px-320 and it had a cheesy, little square sustain pedal that slipped around and had a terrible feel. i heard that casios were finicky about third party pedals, but purchased this anyway. it worked (i needed to set the polarity switch on this pedal to open).it also worked perfectly on my roland rd-300nx, but i expected that. what i love about this pedal is it has a fantastic feel that rivals a real piano, and is the equal to the feel of my expensiveroland rpu-3.one main reason why i gave this five stars in addition to the compatibility is it's built to last. it's heavy, all metal exterior except for the bottom pad, and has a six foot cable that allows you to place it practically anywhere. plus the price is right. in fact, the entire package is impressive when i compared it to other models that i considered. and it's light years ahead of the oem pedals that casio ships with their privia keyboards.

Review: a well built pedal of good quality, with enough weight to keep the body stable, and a good &#34;middle of the travel&#34; execution point for sustain. with the correct keyboard, the pedal will also allow for half pedaling. very important to someone who has keyboards from multiple manufacturers, especially older models; this pedal does has a switch to allow for polarity adjustment (for most newer keyboards this doesn't matter, as polarity can be edited globally, or, alternatively, polarity is sensed on startup so long as the pedal is plugged in) some other pedals, particularly those from name manufacturers, will only work with some keyboards. that said, i feel this m-audio compares favorably to it's most visible competition, yamaha's fc4 offering. the yamaha pedal is a bit heavier, which i do like and subjectively implies better quality, but, in reality, the yamaha did not last under the same circumstances, breaking down and needing a spot repair after a year on the road. last, the yamaha fc4 does not have the half pedaling option or polarity switch, making this m-audio pedal a great all around option.in my case, this pedal has been on the live stage, unpacked and packed, tossed around a fair bit, for 2 1/2 years with no problems.

Review: i've been playing mostly acoustics over 30 years, i own a d35 martin, epiphone dr-212, zager zad50, american fender strat, gibson studio les paul and have owned many others. when my little red traveler showed up at my door i was excited, but my expectation bar wasn't set too high. i unpacked the traveler and gave it the once over,, wow, nicely made. neck was perfect, just the slightest bow, frets were finished better than my gibson when i bought it. i found some wet/dry sand paper, i think 200 grit and spent about 10-15 minutes sanding down the bottom of the bridge bone. wow #2 the action is much above average acoustic guitar quality, no buzz, perfect pitch at the octave and is a joy to play. the tone is unique, not quiet, and unless you are expecting martin sound, definitely not offensive. the sound is kind of acoustic guitar/ukulele, banjo ish. i'm thinking with a nice pickup it would make quite nice/unique a acoustic lead instrument. plays great to the top fret. love it! unbelievable instrument, a pleasure play. oh and the case is a $40+ freebee ;))) buy one, be happy. one last thing, another post mentioned putting your right arm outside the strap and tying between the tuning keys, that works well.

Review: i wanted a guitar i could travel with, something small enough that i actually would carry around after the novelty wore off. this is a great size. i love the large neck size, while it is smaller than a full size guitar, you wont feel it much while playing. the sound for something this size is really good, do not expect to get a full acoustic sound. this guitar is just for you to practice scales, practice a tune.. you wont be performing with this guitar. i did alot of research bought a cheap travel guitar (which i hated, threw it out) and decided i wanted a better one, compared this to the martin backpacker and this has the better sound, the better bag, and all around great travel guitar. the travel case is great, its about the size of a violin case so you know the size..

Review: we got this to save on trunk space when traveling with a guitar. as expected, it doesn't have the sound quality of a full-size instrument, but it sounds good for what it is. it seems to hold a tune well and my son enjoys playing it. the blue color is pretty, and we were pleased with the extras that accompanied the guitar (case, strap, etc). other people have mentioned an odor on the case and strap. we did notice a scent, but it didn't bother anyone. a more odor-sensitive person might feel differently.

Review: i was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of afganistan. i was going to get the martin backpacker, which i have actually seen and held in a store, but other reviews sold me on this washburn. the case was a particular positive point for me, and so was the 25% lower price. i am more than please with what i have received. the case is great for a traveling soldier, rugged and protective, with useful pockets. the guitar itself is very well made, nice pegs and solidly built for such an inexpensive instrument. it does have a bit of a banjo like sound because of the small body, common to the type, as is the initial awkwardness figuring out how to hold, since the full sized fretboard overbalances the tiny body, and you can't exactly rest it on your leg like a regular acoustic. the thing is, this guitar is just plain fun, it is always handy, durable, and plays pretty well. best buy i have made on a product i couldn't try out first. a testament to the quality of the reviews on amazon, which have rarely led me astray.

Review: picked up some blue steel lite stings and some brass abalone pins to enhance tone. also was the last to pick it up for $118.50 shipped to my door. if you like a parlor guitar, this might be for you. the case is kick ass too, easily a $50 value.update: after putting on the brass pins and adding a snark tuner, along with putting on new strings, this guitar rocks. putting the brass pins keeps it from being too top heavy and helps to improve tone. this is my go-to guitar. sounds good and has great intonation. the only fore-seeable upgrade would be to get closed geared tunners but the open geared work fine and hold tunning. i have a washburn d-30 and love this just as much for 1/3 the cost.

Review: i bought this strap to use on an acoustic dreadnought guitar. i would have given this item 5 stars but even fully extended it is about 3&#34;-4&#34; too short. as for the quality of the strap, i love the look and feel of the leather. it has a worn and aged texture that looks great and it would be very comfortable to wear while playing if it were longer.my 2 cents in summary- i think for a classical acoustic guitar or for an electric, this strap would work much better. if you have a larger sized guitar, find a longer strap.

Review: this is a very good nicely wide guitar strap. its weathered look is exactly what i was looking for. its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades. that is what i wanted but that is also why i got it weathered - to speed up about 5 years of personality. i'm not sure how you would wear it out really. its buttery soft and doesn't have a strange fabric suede backing so it won't muck up your clothes, pill or crumble.the only minus is that its a standard 53 inches though the description says its \"long\". pretty standard vs all other straps.i paired this with my reissue fender telecaster thinline in natural. it looks wonderful. i can barely feel the weight of the guitar wearing it. -update: since i got the strap as a christmas gift i've worn it to class and jam sessions. i started getting nice compliments about the guitar. thought the guitar is beautiful i've had it for a while. i think this strap is like a fine piece of jewelry accenting the guitar! beauty and function.

Review: i've been recording professionally for 27 years; music, radio commercials and television mostly. so i'll try to give you the information you need to make your purchase.i've owned and used so many mics and brands through the years i can't remember them all but i can i say i've never had a bad a-t. 4033's, 4050's and 4080's i use every week and have for years, the 4033 going back to the mid 90's and the 2020 is just a lower priced electret condenser from the a-t family. you have no idea the % of recordings that you're hearing this brand on, it's used by almost every studio on every continent, i work in the us, italy to scotland and can attest to this. but first let me tell you, very simply, where the negative reviewers went wrong.this is a xlr connection phantom powered mic, which is pro and best. so it requires a phantom powered xlr input, which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces. which you should really purchase along with this, if you haven't already, because for around $100 you'll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring, you'll find one by searching audio interfaces. i have a rolandroland tri capture audio interfaceand a focusrite i use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you don't need avid hd's to get started. audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter. getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been sop since the dawn of digital. i see that small usb mixers are available which would be another option. don't try an adapter on it, it won't work, as this needs power through the cord to charge the field effect transistor, but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want. it doesn't come with the cord, what a surprise! quality cords will cost about half the price of this, but a $15 version will probably do for most.it doesn't come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like. work with it, you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do. you'll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeshure popper stopper pop filteris the usual, but i can also recommend using 2 large $1.49 foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen. this isn't about being cheap, there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and don't work at strange angles and you'll probably always need one or the other.this does not come with a stand, so pick up a boom stand if you don't have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over, 18 wheelers also tip over.recommendeduse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where they've put a faux plastic one. if it's possible, you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks, eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the waymicrophone flange male. for desktop users, here's what i'd do. using large command strips and velcro i'd fasten this to the deskadjustable desk microphone standand attach thistelescoping mini-boomhere's another optionmxl mics mxl-bcd-standunderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting, if you need something figure it out, your clean, quiet recording is proof that it works.i can't justify comparing this to my $500 to $4000 mics like it but if there is a better value buy it. $82 wouldn't have bought a case for most of my condensers. it sure beats most non electret, electrostatic dc bias or dynamic style mics. the 2020 is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a 4033 without issue. also individual mics have a sound, of the eight 4033's i have, i prefer 3 of them and use them the most. so when reviewers say it's bright, i say compared to what? i can tell you what it sounds like.....ka-ching! a great sound in audio recording. uh huh, i know of one professional recording it's on and the client was clueless that i used an $82 mic. think about it, would this be as good as what was used 40 years ago? have you heard good 70's recordings? anyone purchasing equipment because it review ers have opinions about this mic so don't ignore them but ask yourself this, do they have formal training and experience with 200 different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities? any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost $400 and won't be half of what you'll achieve by improving your recording technique.this type of mic is excellent for overhead, acoustics, amps or brass and of course vocals, really most recording needs, having a less uni and more omni, cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern it's better suited to recording. just understand you can't get too loud near it or you'll overdrive it since it's designed for up to screaming vocals, so back off with loud amps and brass, which also means you need a quiet place for recording because it'll pick up your ac ducts and your neighbor's tv. that, is a good thing, what's bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment, so don't blame a mic for your extraneous room noise. you can't just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind, just quiet, anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical, rather than electronic, signal to noise ratio. a 10db pad will reduce output but doesn't affect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam won't help, that's not even its purpose, i suggest reading this on acoustics and foam, link removed(just replace the [dot]). turn off your heat/air, be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between 3 and 5 am, when the world's a quieter place and that will really help, you'll likely hear how loud your computer fans are. you can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls, or buy used office partitions but you need quiet, i've known acoustic players who've worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing. if this is what your budget allows for it's an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost. i keep saying \"this type of mic\" and the reason why is because a-t sells 14 models like this style up to $3000. this model is the lowest priced but you're buying a reputable brand. if your future plans include using only one mic, without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware, you can look here.audio-technica at2020 usb condenser usb microphoneor hereaudio technica at2020usb+ cardioid condenser microphone w/pop filterthis is not my advice, you will also lose the higher quality playback and the supplied recording software that comes with an interface. this model is not USB.Now pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds, i won't tell you because how it sounds to me on my system won't apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio, descriptions are worthless, only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters. this is important, all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn't, the recording cannot sound better than the source, so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone. accurate or inaccurate, not good or bad, there's a difference. it's during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound. apply these same thoughts to your home stereo, saying instead, playback cannot sound better than the recording and that's why accuracy is important in your monitors.so search out any info you don't understand and don't expect to be a competent engineer without years of schooling, training and having worked in a professional setting. if you're lucky like i was, after 1 year of tech school i worked on site repair (studios often need pt) and apprenticed while continuing my education for the next 3, then after 3 years of work (tv) with another year of school i became a studio owner. real recording involves a facility, equipment and techniques as involved as a surgeon in a hospital. so study electronics, acoustics, the auditory cortex, everything audio, train yourself to hear the smallest sounds all day, it never stops. when making any purchases i recommend reading and research and realize this is a tool and because you can buy a tool doesn't mean you're educated in its use. so yes, i also don't recommend buying a scalpel and trying surgery on your little brother, unless.....but everyone of us started somewhere so get some equipment and start recording, quit all that sleeping, eating and other unnecessary activities and just read and record! just short sessions at a real studio will also open your eyes and be educational and some will allow you to just stop in and talk, i have. so keep up the research because no man knows it all and i'm just here to help you out. if you need a good, small, inexpensive stereo amp check this one out. topping tp22 digital mini amplifier

Review: this was exactly what i needed for the price range i could afford in a crunch. my old mic just wasn't cutting it going into my computers usb audio interface.there are nice changes in sound texture from different angles. it is really sensitive to pop and breath so a pop filter is critical for vocals. it is recording my guitar beautifully.i've even been able to record nice quick tracks for copyright recordings of both my voice and guitar. i've set the stand low and angled the mic towards the guitars sound hole (slightly back) and sing into the top at about 45 degrees and back a little. i found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean.i'm very happy with this unit (price considered but i'd have to pay a lot more to improved on it). i'll probably get another one. i kind of wish i'd have bought that combo kit.

Review: i bought this as a gift for a friend he was really happy with it but, i have a completely different view. the at2020 is a pretty bright mic which sounds good at first but once you layer tracks on top of each other it can sound very harsh. second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser. it is a very good mic for people starting out in music or just using it for podcasts, but there are a bunch of better mics near this price. two that come to mind are the mxl v67g and studio projects b1 (stay away from the studio projects c1) both exceptional microphones for the price. although there is one mic you that is a bit more expensive but is absolutely amazing, the mxl 2003a. a lot of people have claimed the studio projects c1 sounds like the neumann u87 it doesn't, the mxl 2003a however sounds very similar and is easily the best ldc mic under $500. with that being said the at2020 is not a bad microphone but it is not great, to people who have just used built in mics on there computer or camera this will blow them away but as time goes on they will learn the limitations of this microphone.although to be fair i have a lot of experience in pro audio and production, so i maybe a bit overly critical. one thing is for sure though; there are definitely better mics in or near this price range.

Review: the material it's made of is good, and it holds the guitar. the only things i don't like are 2.1)each of the corners has a cap. the one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off.2)the part at the bottom that looks like a u (used to hold the guitar) it spins... it means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still, so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight.i would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one.

Review: in life you mostly get what you pay for. this stand really isn't an exception. getting what you pay for though doesn't mean that it won't do what you need it to do. this stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it. the great thing is, it doesn't need to be any heavier or needlessly fancy to do exactly what it needs to do. it's a great choice for someone looking to keep their guitars from becoming damaged while they sit out waiting to be played. even though they will not get damaged while laying around they are still easily accessible for you to play as opposed to having them stored in a case.for $10 a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar. putting them on display and allowing them to be handy when the urge strikes you to play. you now have no excuse for your expensive (or cheap) guitar to get beat up from laying around.

Review: not perfect but a solid stand. prone to tipping over if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do. and the bottom part that holds the guitar isn't fixed so it's good and bad. good because it'll hand nearly and shape guitar at odd angles. bad because if you just toss your guitar onto it the way i do, sometimes it just swings around annoyingly.

Review: i bought one of these for each of my electric guitars (3) and really like them. they work great, were easy to assemble, and not expensive. i do think the name is a bit inapproriate because i would never use one on stage, i don't think they are sturdy enough. these are great if you don't have to worry about pets or children possibly bumping into them. i realize you won't normally have pets or children on stage, but sometimes there are people moving around and guitars do get knocked over. i recommend the on stage xcg4 for home use or if you have a practice room where you know your guitar is safe. i use these primarily for electric guitars but also have one for an acoustic and it fits very nicely. great deal for the very low price.

Review: not crazy about having to pay shipping that amounted to half the purchase price for the stand, not to mention having to wait five days for it to arrive. no assembly instructions were included in the packaging. i've never owned something like this before, so that was annoying. luckily, some nice pictures were posted on the web page and i was able to figure it out from there. once i got it put together, and placed my beloved guitar in the thing, i got happier. it looks nice and holds the guitar safely (padding protects the guitar finish). i'd recommend this stand to others, but be aware of shipping, tax and consider the possibility it will arrive with no assembly instructions. not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together, still...

Review: i am a believer that if you have a musical instrument, it has to be out if you are going to use it regularly. with these sturdy stands, my guitars are out and around the house and they seem to &#34;talk to me&#34; every time that i walk by. this encourages, if not compulses, me to pick them up and play them for 5-15 minutes at a time. these stands are inexpensive, light, and hold the guitar well. i would not recommend them for heavy, on the road, stage work, but then again, most of us are not on the road nor the tour. we are just playing for the love of it.

Review: i bought this two years ago for use with a takamine. it hasn't seen heavy use. it wasn't supposed to. it sits in a corner of the living room, holds the guitar securely, and doesn't cause problems. although it does make my ownership of a guitar more obvious, and my 91 yo neighbor was convinced for a year that i was drunk and wailing away on the guitar at 3 am. at least, that's what she told the police.this stand is very similar to the slightly better selling musician's gear stand. they might actually be the same stand under different names. the pricing for both is very close if you consider shipping. if i were to buy a stand again, i would still get this one because it's available under prime. the other one isn't. that gives this stand more value.the stand is very easy to set up. the lower cradle is not fixed and adjusts itself to the appropriate position for your guitar. this took a little getting used to, but it does work very well. the padding on the stand does protect my guitar well. extended contact with the guitar surface has not caused any problems.given the very low price, this is an excellent choice for a living room stand. if you're on the road or performing, you might need something a bit different, but i can definitely recommend this for casual players like myself.

Review: purchased these for a new heritage h-575 arch top. a few months later, the high E string unwound from the ball end. overall good strings, good sound -- this set simply didn't last very long. i will replace with 12s however. for me the 11s felt a little loose. the 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box. i have 12s on an epiphone joe pass model. i'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s.

Review: i bought my first set of these strings about two years ago and havent looked back since. awesome feel, sound and price. just the right thickness for playing all the classic rock and acoustic stuff that i do. i know they are electric strings but they do sound nice when playing acoustically written songs on my strat. one thing i notice with these is that they seem to sound new a lot longer than others i have tried. thats nice.

Review: these strings have a tonal quality that will change your life, if you'eve ever wondered how the greats such as wes montgomery, george benson, and larry coryell have been able to get their awesome, mellow tones. i'd recommend this even to metal players as a change of pace, as they may get something out of it that they've never considered before. obviously, this takes someone who is willing to give a change to their accustomed style of playing a try. trust me - i've been playing professionally for decades, and i can say that there's no way i'd turn my back on these as a jazz enthusiast. also, if you're interested in saving the skin on your fingers, this product will help, as i haven't even come close to the normal amount of skin shedding experienced previously on roundwounds.

Review: i had put these on, and my wife picked my guitar to play, and she was confused.they do take some time getting used to. they don't rip up your hand as much, and if you keep your fingers on the strings as you shift, there is less friction. this is good, but it takes some getting used to. i used that finger-tip friction to let me know where i was on the fretboard. with these, i found myself over-shifting both high and low.i like them, and they sound nice, but i bought some round wounds to replace these when the time comes.

Review: flatwound? ribbon wound? it's all the same, no squeak, slick, jazzer mellow in tone. it's a sound that many would like to acheive. but why not round wounds? round wounds give a bit of grip, round wounds also have more surface area and are louder. okay, but i have a pickup, want the mellower tone, sans finger noise. it's important for my playing to not have finger noise.i have the les paul for harder edged music, but the archtop jazzbox pleads for a mellower tone, hence the flats.i have a couple of friends who are really great jazz guitar stylists, they both use d'addario chromes - over nickel, so i thought i would try them out. nice, buttery smooth and i couldn't really recognized the difference over nickel flats, except the price, and the wear seemed a bit better.wear and tear is not really a factor for me, as i change out strings every 3 to 6 weeks depending on how much i'm playing.not ready to take the plunge? it is a different feel, if not, try half rounds. they're a hybrid of both, less finger noise, a bit more surface area, hence output. output is not a problem if you are amplified.check them out. i use the medium gauge, with a 13 high E, the g is wound also. finger style or with a heavy dunlap tortex pick, the attack noise is also reduced with the flats. i like them alot.

Review: i'm a bassist, and am familiar with the flat/round/half-round debate on basses (i prefer flats). anyway, my son wanted these for his epiphone casino because he heard john lennon used (a different brand of) flat-wounds. they sound amazing! they make that casino ring like a carillon, yet will get &#34;down & dirty&#34; when called for. a very &#34;different&#34; sound range than round wounds. in fact, it's about time to order another set or three....

Review: thee only flatwound strings i've tried that sound significantly better than these are the thomastiks, which cost twice as much, and they're not twice as good. maybe if i was a working pro i'd buy the thomastiks, but for me, the d'addarios sound good, and last a long time.if you've never played flatwounds, you might be surprised to discover that they far outlast round wound strings. that's because what kills the sound of strings is gunk from your fingers and the air getting in between the windings and damping the vibration. back when guitar strings were more a lot more expensive, it wasn't that unusual to remove strings, boil them, and put them back on. some electric bassists still do this.) with flats, the gunk doesn't get in between the wraps, and if you don't break a string you can play a set for months.i have different guitars set up with different strings ranging from 10s (my fenders) to 13 (my archtop.) rockers playing 10s and 09s might be intimidated by 13s, but they're not that much harder to play, and after a little practice it's easy. jazzers seldom if ever play six-string bar chords or bend strings, which means you just don't need that much muscle anyway. flatwounds are also generally set with a fairly low action. they don't vibrate as widely as roundwounds, so they don't need as much clearance.if you're looking for that classic electric jazz guitar sound, flats are the way to go, and the d'addarios are as good as you need. (rockers looking for that 60s sound might try the d'addario flatwound 10s. almost the same sound as the pyramids, and a lot cheaper.)

Review: have these on my tele, very interesting to play around with. i bought the regular gauge first and usually use pink slinkeys on all my electrics, the regular chromes where like telephone wires compared to my regular gauge so i bought these instead. these were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys. they still are heavier and you can really feel it when bending but they add a completely different feel to playing guitar and your tone. when playing these i tend to play more sixties inspired, the flats help capture that surf guitar tone which is really cool. i really like them but they are completely different and i wouldn't recommend them to everyone. as far as cq goes these are great, no problems, feel great, sound great.

Review: this brush is used to remove static electricity and light dust from records before each playing. this is not a deep cleaning, dust or dirt removal brush; it is a compliment to record cleaning solutions like this excellent liquid cleaner by last (last pc power cleaner 3/4 oz.).the brush is super simple to use, with the album on your turntable, hold it at roughly a ninety degree angle for about two revolutions, and then sweep it off the lp. no fuss, no muss, no fooling around. never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers. when there is visible dust on the fibers, give the brush a good flick by rotating the handle across the fibers. after each use, rotate the handle around to cover the fibers. if you press the brush too hard against the album, or do the deep dive sharp angle trick, fibers will be broken off the brush. just press lightly against the rotating lp, sweep the brush off the lp, and all will be wonderful with this brush.this brush is sold under many different brand names, clearaudio, audioquest, and thorens.the brush comes with no instructions for use, an odd omission. maybe there is an assumption that the brush is so easy to use, instructions would be redundant.audiophile or not, this brush is a must have for anyone that still loves analog recordings.

Review: this is a great addition to any stereo system today, assuming you still use your turntable. two passes with this brush will clean up any of my records and get them ready for play, free of any annoying pops or clicks. it won't save a dirty record, you'll have to buy a cleaning solution for that, but this brush will easily take care of dust, hair, and other particles that get attracted to your lps during regular use. as another reviewer suggested, i do the first pass with the brush going with the record, as if i was spreading out paint or something like that, and that gets most of the surface particulate free. the second pass is with the brush going directly against the motion of the record, and this cleans out the dust from inside the grooves of the record. after that, your record will sound brand new again!there are definitely more comprehensive cleaning and maintenance options, but none that are this easy and this cheap.

Review: the version i picked came with a grounding wire, claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic-producing snap, crackles, and pops. if you believe that, continue to do so, and maybe you'll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device. speaking more pragmatically, i've found some use for the item only when loose, conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc.

Review: seems to get a bit of dust up off the surface of the record, but frankly, the old discwasher type with the fluid does a much better job. better yet is to clean your records well with warm water and dish soap (and a new paint brush), then rinse them well and dry with a clean micro fiber cloth. just try not to get the labels wet.

Review: i've used a few different strap lock systems and this is by far my favorite design (not to mention the most affordable which must be due to its simplicity). to use these, you put your strap on your guitar (as usual) then put the locks on. rotate the smaller piece until the holes line up then slide the lock on above the strap. once the lock has passed the head of the guitar's strap button, rotate the smaller piece again until the holes do not line up (close position) which should be about 180 degrees from open position. very simple and works very well.I have not used any lock system that's perfect. every one that i've used failed at one point or another (came off unexpectedly). these work exceptionally well. what i like about this design is that it doesn't require any modifications on the guitar or the strap. you can use the strap you like without adding anything to it and you don't have to replace the guitar's existing strap buttons.but they do stick out a bit (to keep the strap from sliding off) so if you're concerned about looks, you might want to try another system that's more discreet. also, i tend to use thinner leather straps that have thinner ends. these will likely not work very well with thicker straps that tend to take up most of the height of most strap buttons.

Review: i'm using this with an ovation balladeer. a guitar with a rounded back that demands you use it with a guitar strap at all times. my guitar strap is over 50 years old, circa 1967, so the leather is a bit worn and it had a tendency to slide off the strap holders on the guitar at the most inopportune times.with these strap loks, the strap never comes off. i leave it on when i put the guitar in the case, and they are there and waiting when i get it back out. i've had it on for 2 and a half months now, with no problems. the hardest part was putting them on, which really wasn't hard at all, just took a moment to understand the mechanics of the mechanism and voila' bob's your uncle!!recommend these for anyone who needs to keep their guitar strapped and ready for action. they are plastic and will wear out someday, i'll buy another pair then.

Review: i've read where people are using bottle caps instead of these. my guitar is more valuable to me than that i suppose, because i'm not trusting that my expensive gitty won't hit the floor. i mean you pay for a quality instrument right? why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe? i'm sorry but that's just idiocy in action. this isn't 1960, get an upgrade already. i play standing up 95% of the time, so these are a necessity. i have had these separate on me when taking them off hastily, but all except one snapped right back together. when i first started playing, i had a brand new (to me) guitar hit the floor and the neck break because i didn't use them. that's something that should only happen once in your life, if at all. the only complaint i have is whatever happened to the round ones? they were a bit more appealing to the eye and do the same thing just as well.

Review: i read the reviews here on amazon and was kind of turned off of buying it at first. eventually i went ahead and sprung for it since it wasn't expensive. i only needed one, and expected the package to come with just one, but it has two locks so that was a pleasant surprise. i've had them for 2-3 months now and they haven't failed me yet. they keep the strap in place just fine and are fairly sturdy for plastic pieces. really helped a lot because my strap would keep slipping off the knob and i had to use my ninja skills to get the guitar before it hit the floor. the only complaint i have is that they fit a bit tight with my strap (though it could be my nylon strap is just a bit too thick) and they are an extremely snug fit which makes me kinda nervous. however, i keep them as tight as i can while still allowing them to rotate a bit so everything is fine so far. not sure why the other reviews were so negative, but i have no complaints.

Review: i ordered these for a gibson songwriter deluxe ec custom vintage and they seem a little bit thinner with slightly smaller heads and a micro-touch longer than the stock pins from gibson.the pins measure: 28mm -or- 1 1/4\" inches in length.i was going to return them but figured i would try them out in my gibson blues king l-00 parlor sized guitar.it was about the same result, a little too thin, smaller heads and slightly longer but i went ahead and tried them.glad i did.i didn't think that after using the tusq bridge that came stock from gibson it would make any detectable difference but i was wrong. i can tell a slight difference. i did not remove the strings, just loosened them so it was compared to the set that was on it, which were fresh from yesterday.a small amount of improvement in sustain and high end frequencies ringing out was noticeable.they also provide a graph in the packaging info, but i think that it was a test using both the tusq pins and replacement saddle. if you haven't changed your saddle...do it now and get rid of that soft plastic one.i must admit, i did order these with about 75% of \"dressing up\" the guitar in mind, and any amount of tonal improvement would be gladly appreciated but not expected. i got both.white with paua dot inlay looks very nice and provides the eye candy i was seeking, although there is no care taken as to \"match the dots\" for consistency, -they will vary in appearance.the tusq pins being a wee bit smaller seem to slide down all the way...right away and need to be pushed all the way into the slot while stringing up the guitar. the heads set flush to the bridge mount compared to the gibson stock plastic pins that stick up a little higher, and i do wish that the tusq pins were the same size.i will see how well they do on the blues king and most likely will order new pins for the songwriter deluxe once they pass the test of time and playing for a month or two. i don't expect them to cause any problems and should provide the extra sustain and ringing that is very much appreciated in any small amount or fashion!if in doubt, consider changing your strings to a brand that might be more suited for the \"tone\" you have in mind, be it darker, brighter, softer, louder, etc. strings make a big difference and i find using d'addario phosphor bronze strings very bright & ringy, last long, are affordable, and seem noticeably louder than ghs or ernie ball. (steel strings only - does not apply to nylon or gut strings.)once again, if you have a plastic saddle and/or nut then these pins might not make much of a noticeable difference...then again, they might make all the difference in the world! you just have to try them and see.they are inexpensive and pretty...well worth the risk!

Review: what's most impressive isn't the top-drawer leather and craftsmanship -- that goes without saying from levy's. it's the clever design, the way it fits onto almost any guitar strap, adjusts to almost any position, and adjusts to (almost) any small wireless transmitter. transmitter, not receiver!

Review: i had intended to carry this, with my keys, attached to my chain wallet. but the wallet hasn't arrived yet so be warned it is a little bit of a pocket space eater. but i suspected it would be before i ordered it so i don't count that against it. holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tight...almost annoyingly hard to get one out. will be sure to update if wear & tear has any effect on the grip on the picks. but so far, so great and would consider purchasing this for my musically inclined friends.

Review: most of the time i am able to use the g7 capo with one hand when moving it, adjusting it, and clamping it in place. however, sometimes i have to use both hands to squeeze it in place so the strings don't buzz. that may seem like not such a big deal, but i prefer to have an easier one to work with. i have small hands, and an old carpal injury, so i prefer to have as little strain as possible to place the capo. this one is better than the any of the clasping kinds (keysers, etc) in that respect. after a couple of playing sessions, i figured out how best to use this capo with just one hand most of the time. now that i've learned how best to use it, i'll keep it. when i first got it i was upset that i had to use 2 hands and forcible squeezing to put in place, but now i've learned how to work it better so that i can do most of it with one hand without too much strain.a capo should: be easy to remove and put on, stay in tune, not hurt the hands (no 2 handed squeezing), not interfere with playing when inserted, and it shouldn't break too soon (have at least several months to a year before breaking if at all).on the plus side, this unit seems pretty well made, so it should last a long time. i think it meets all the criteria except for having to squeeze it tight periodically.i've tried so many capos now, and the only ones i liked were the planet waves screw tops, they are easy to use, easy to move from fret to fret, light on the hands, stay in tune and out of the way, but they break in damp california weather (i've had 4 of them break on me, within a couple months. they snap and go airborn, which is dangerous). next i'll try the dunlop victor capos, they are screw tops similar in style to the planet waves (dunlop also makes the planet waves capos), but they are made with more durable bronze, so they should last longer, and i hope those will be the best for me. i also ordered an aluminum version of the planet waves in hopes it won't break like their thermoplastic ones do.if you have small hands like me, and don't want to strain the hands while playing, like me, then that rules out the kysers and any of the squeezing type of capos. the shubs fall off and are a hassle all around to take off and on and adjust, and the springtop ones are suspect as well. that's why i like the screwtops that don't get in the way and are easy to adjust. ok, i hope the dunlop victor will do the job for me now, i'll try it next.

Review: i bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what i found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something). the release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.bottom line: if you don't mind the extra effort and don't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using, then maybe you will enjoy it. for everyone else, look elsewhere.

Review: i bought this because after i rebuilt a guitar that was very special to me it wouldn't stay in tune. i took it to a number of guys thinking i did something wrong in the build and was just overlooking it. i use a capo a lot so when someone recommended this...i thought they were crazy. i'm not paying that much for a capo and i doubt that is the problem. well....i broke down and i'm glad i did. this thing is amazing. it solved the problem because i can set the tension and the design make it sit just right on my strat. spend the money...it's worth it. only con is that it takes some practice to change it quickly.

Review: this new type and design of capos, manufactued in england (and warranteed for life) is truly wonderful. available in six and twelve string steel-string as well as a new classical version, they are all easy to use, solidly built and - perhaps most importantly, easy to put on and take off with one hand without having to retune! for a musician, this is the most cricial element - that, and that it is 'kind' to the materials used in the manufacture of a good guitar. i use mine on a martin hd28 and have had no problems whatsoever. a great move toward a new generation of capos! not cheap - but worth every cent.

Review: this capo works on my acoustics as well as electrics and is no-fuss with positive micro-action that allows you to apply just the right pressure by simply squeezing it down after it is in place. holds the notes securely and with marvelous clarity giving you a pure new guitar tuning at whichever fret you choose. removal is simple also, just press the release tab and it's ready to remove, no muss no fuss, it really does work that well. highly recommend.

Review: i've tried kyser capos and they're good. they work. this capo, however, just works simply, smoothly, and it's a great pleasure to operate. like a seagull vs a taylor 8 series, they both work, but one has more beauty in its being. made in china, designed in europe, slippery, a bit heavy, but still very, very nice. it's more money than i'd have liked to have paid, but i'm glad i did. did it improve my life? not at all. it also didn't improve my guitar playing - but somehow it's just so much nicer to have than any other capo i've used.

Review: this capo is expensive. the first time i (and everybody else) saw one, i said, \"wow. i can get a kyser or something for fifteen bucks. get out of here.\"five capos later, i realize that i could probably have just shelled out the money, instead of purchasing every other capo on the market, one at a time, over the last fifteen years.the first and last thing that really needs to be said about the g7th is this -- it doesn't put my guitar out of tune. virtually at all. i can capo all the way up to the seventh or eighth fret and my micro-sensitive tuner shows that i'm still within one glowing light of being perfectly on. that's it. yes, the g7th is sleek and beautiful, like a tiny sculpture, and glorious to look at, and sometimes i just want to stare at it. yes, it's easy to put on, just a mere squeeze of the hand away from being perfectly in place. yes, it appears to be sturdy enough to outlive me and my descendants. but the tuning thing is all that really sets one capo apart from another, at the end of the day, and this one kills it.i own three shubbs, a kyser, a dunlop, and one of those rolling capos. they're all good. i don't hate any of them. but this capo takes away all the uncertainty and irritation of being a fraction out of tune with the rest of the band, or with myself. it makes playing guitar with a capo effortless and a joy.

Review: as musicians, sometimes we find just the right sound or feel with a piece of equipment and it changes everything taking our performance to a new level. for me it happened when i found just the right sound & feel from my taylor acoustic guitar, the right vocal mics, the right mixer, my bose l1 model ii, etc.today i had one of those finds. after years of being somewhat dissatisfied with every capo i've encountered i discovered the perfect capo for me: the g7th performance capo. i'm not kidding - it was one of those finds. as an acoustic guitar player / vocalist, obviously, i have to play all of my songs in the right key for an optimum vocal performance. this means occasionally relying on a capo to get just the right key with just the right chord shape/structure. unfortunately, some of my songs had review s & videos i watched that i'd have to pinch-down on the open end fairly firmly for a secure hold - this was not the case. i think the g7th has just the right width & density of foam under the top bar: a) providing more \"friction\" to hold this capo in place; b) playing a role in very effectively dampening the strings; & c) possibly being more gentle on the strings than a more narrow/harder foam or rubber top bar, thus having less impact on tuning.i did find one slight negative about this capo which i was able to quickly overcome. the end of the top metal bar (on the open end of capo) is slightly more \"squared-off\" than the end of the bottom piece (which in contrast is rounded off). it may be just the way i play some chords, but my hand was contacting that squared-off end of the top bar & was getting irritated - so i simply turned the capo around with the open end facing me (versus facing the floor) & the surfaces contacting my hand were far smoother - thus, zero irritation. this was nothing new to me - i have had to do this with other capos.others have commented on the cost of this capo. for me, the cost of this capo was nothing compared to the many thousands of dollars i've spent finding just the right guitars, pa's, mics, & other equipment / accessories. i almost can't believe it only cost me $40 to make such a difference in my sound. the g7th performance capo is priceless !!!overall, i highly RECOMMEND this capo - if you're like me - this could be a very inexpensive way to take your performance to the next level !!! i'm a strong believer in having back-ups for critical components so i will immediately purchase another g7th as a back-up (maybe i'll order the black or gold & use my silver one as the back-up).

Review: this is the last capo you will ever need to buy unless you have the need for both curved and straight capos for various fretboards in which case you'll still want to stay with the g7th capos for both needs. no need to worry about damaging your guitar neck from over tightening or nonpadded contact. no spring clamp to wear out & lose gripping strength which produces a buzz over time. low profile design is the easiest for playability as you don't have to learn to play around it like you do on a keyser. the unique, adjustable tension also allows you to control to sound to your liking, great for advanced tricks like capoing just a few strings. can't say enough about this easy to use tool with ultra simple, unobtrusive design. love it and have one in every case.

Review: a friend of mine who is a guitar repair genus (and budding luthier) recommended this capo when i mentioned intonation problems with my guitar...i had always had some issues with it, but it was liveable. the real problem began when i switched to different strings- silk and steels. i loved the tone i was now getting, but the intonation problems were suddenly much worse.what i had not considered, until my friend mentioned it, is that while my new strings provide the tonal warmth i was looking for, they are also easier to \"bend out of tune\". (duh, i should have thought about this, it makes perfect sense in retrospect!) the capo i had been using was putting way too much pressure on the strings, and greatly exacerbated the existing issue... one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired.so he mentioned this capo, and i immediately chortled. ($50 bucks? that's how much he payed. yikes!)then he grabbed his g7 from the car and let me try it. the strings stayed in tune! that's $350 on repair i can pocket for other things, at least for the time being. i was so impressed!i ordered one the next day.i am sure i will miss not being able to stick it on the usual perch when i am playing live, but it is really easy to use in general, and i won't look back. the intonation issues are greatly reduced, and i am thrilled.worth every penny.

Review: we bought the pyle-pro lavalier wireless microphone system for use with thepyle pwma230. we needed an extra wireless mic for our workshop presenters and this was a very inexpensive choice. for the price, this worked a lot better than i expected but it did take some adjustment to the \"trim screw\" on the receiver to get the clarity and range needed. we also had to tape the little wire antenna up so it wasn't hanging in front of the speaker (this might not be an issue for you, depending on where you plug yours in).there are a lot of very expensive wireless mic units that i'm sure would provide better sound and range, but this one works just fine for our uses.overall, a good value for the low cost of this unit.

Review: barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer's defects ... the unit does what it was meant to do. i do however question whether the word \"pro\" should apply to this system. although the 1/4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer, the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system. the signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about. to its defense, it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away.after playing with the device for a couple more minutes, i noticed that any movement whether i kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and i moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception. even the length of the mic cord, whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality. yikes!!! perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which i previously described above. i'm afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes. i'll probably be returning this unit asap.

Review: if you have a better mic, you can plug that into the transmitter as it's a simple mini jack (1/8&#34;) and that helps this sound wise quite a bit! i will say range is not great, it won't go 500 feet like my expensive sennheiser kit but this will go about 30 feet line of sight before cutting out.note it's vhf, not UHF so it is more prone to interference.i find the transmitters' to be cheap and the battery cover does not fit all that well. i also wish it was an xlr connection. a lock on the plug to the transmitter would also have been nice and note the clip and all that is plastic so don't toss this around or it will break.for general use in doors, it's decent and for sure worth the price...but if you're looking for something clear, you should look to spend at least $500 on a wireless lapel or handheld system.

Review: my wife & myself are a celtic duo and a number of our shows are at renaiessance fairs where no visable pa equipment is allowed. we considered a wireless to use with a battery powered crate taxi which could easily be hidden but most wireless receivers need a power outlet & at these events no power is available. when i saw this at the price offered and that both the mic transmitter and the receiver were battery powered i thought it was worth a try. in the past we had a problem keeping an audiance because at some events where the natural acoustics are less than stellar they just plain couldn't hear the stories in the songs. we use this to give our voices a small, unobvious boost. it kind of has the effect of adding a tweeter to a speaker in that it gives our voices the clairity to be understood. the result has been that audiances now stay for the entire show, laughing at the comedy, crying at the tragedy. our tips & cd sales have gone way up. is it high fidelity? quite simply, no. but in our case it works beautifully. recommended, just remember the price point and you won't be disappointed.

Review: these tuning machines are great.they are a little heavier than the stock tuners on my guitars but they help keep your guitar in tune as intended.i needed the tuners replaced on an applause (ovation copy) guitar (the bushings fell out of one of the tuners and it became really floppy and refused to stay in tune)and a washburn guitar. they fit on my washburn and my applause perfectly with zero need to ream or drill.the tuner hole size is .391 or 25/64 and of course if your hole size is smaller you must either use a drill or tuner reamer (yes a tuner reamer is a real tool just look at a place like stewart macdonald). you may be required to pre-drill for the screws that go through the back of the tuner.it is only one hole and very small.The vendor was quick in sending these tuners but there was no way to trace the package and it became difficult to receive it due to the fact it had to be signed for.the run around at the post office of getting it re-sent was ridiculous.the vendor should try to provide a tracking number so customers can avoid all of the back and forth and have an estimate as to when the package will arrive.

Review: i bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my hondo ii \"the paul\ which i bought in 1980. the stock ones were loose, lots of backlash in the worm gears, and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still new.they went in easily, if you follow this hint( if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged, disregard this hint)- the holes for the old machine heads on the hondo ii were 0.305\" in diameter, and these new grovers need a 0.390\" diameter hole. so i had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes. it's almost impossible to use a drill, even in a drill press, without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock. i read online suggestions about using a round wood file, and reamer, etc.. so what i did was first use a threading tap( for metal screw threads) which at the bottom had a 0.290\" diameter, and at the top had a 0.375\" diameter. this is a standard 3/8\"-24 threading tap. i chucked the tap into my battery-powered hand drill, set to low speed, and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to 0.375\" in diameter. then i used a tapered reamer, from both sides, to enlarge the holes to the required diameter. quick, clean, easy. if you have a different size enlargement to make, use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to 0.390\" diameter.another hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time, like when changing strings. you don't want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod. at least i don't want to!now the guitar stays in tune, and is easier and more accurate to tune.a very worthwhile upgrade! zero backlash in the worm gears on the grovers, beautifully chromed and smooth as silk.

Review: i just installed these on my chibson lp from overseas. i had to rout out the holes a bit and make them ever so slightly larger.. i took a slightly larger drill bit and turned it backwards, not forwards, by hand slowly, until it was perfect. i also put some blue masking tape on the headstock just in case i slipped. took me about 1.5 hours.the ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance. really close, but they were terrible in operation. i have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar. haven't played them yet, but all the reviews were good, so here goes.....update: played for a couple hours. first thing i notice is that they are geared lower than the old chibsons and the other tuners on my other guitars.. you tune it a full turn, and the tune moves up slightly. which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment.this fixed the chibson tuning issue. i'll order another set for my other chibson.also, i have two epiphones. i believe these are nicer than the epi's.so i bought based solely on the reviews here. i wasn't disappointed. in fact, i am pretty impressed. good replacement for \"iffy\" tuners. they worked for me...

Review: this works better than the qk10b model by the same company. slim and easy to install though longer than the qk10b. since the cut out and button are on only one side of the two parts, you might have to rotate a mic boom, etc., to achieve a proper position after connecting the two parts. my use was for an ipad clamp attached to a mic stand. it worked well and i put two of these in place so the stand could break down for packing in a gear bag. this unit wiggles a little but not as much as the qk10b so the little bit of movement is acceptable. this looks to be well built and should be reliable. the long haul will be the test.

Review: this is just what the doctor ordered. i bought three and am purchasing 3 more. all of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders. if i switch one mic to another stand, it could not be easier, just a press of a little button. with different shock mounts on different mics, i don't have to worry about re-threading the mounts each time i change mic stands. the time it saves is also invaluable. no problem with quality control on the 3 i now have, and i have no complaint with the build. great for the studio, where i use mine, would think it would be clumsy for a performer who takes a mic on and off a stand, use a clip for that.addendum:i love these so much, i have bought one for each mic in my locker, and each stand. that's a total of 12. none of them have failed after almost a years worth of use, the best invention for a mic since the shock mount. these will save you time, guaranteed!

Review: i have used a variety of these types of adapters in the past, and these are an excellent newer version. in this case i bought just one quick release to use for mounting a kick drum microphone that has the stand adapter permanently attached to the microphone. with this quick release installed on the stand and the microphone, the kick drum microphone now mounts to the stand in mere seconds and stays in place very well.I don't quite know why the locking ring is silver on an adapter that is black everywhere else, but at least the ring is good quality and the threads are clean and precise.

Review: the eminence patriot cannabis rex is probably the smoothest sounding guitar speaker i've ever heard. period.this does not mean that it's dull sounding or muffled at least, not if you hearing is still good. i hesitated quite a bit before i decided to buy it and install it in my fender mustang ii but my worries were for naught. incredibly, it tamed the icepick highs without losing the shimmer and clarity of my clean sounds. yet, for overdrive sounds, there is very little fuzziness - just a big full and fat sound that's articulate without being buzzy. if you play metal you'll probably hate this speaker but if you like bluesy, classic rock and jazzy sounds, this is a speaker to seriously consider. i turned my mustang ii into an open back combo and the cannabis rex gave the amp the low end extension that it needed. i had to turn the treble control up a bit more but unlike most amps, it never got shrill or piercing, just buttery smooth and clear. it's also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db@1w/1m.i don't know how eminence did it but i love it!

Review: i've used these straplocks for many years on all my electric instruments; they're fairly inexpensive, and i've never had a problem with them, never broke one nor had to replace them because of wear/abuse, and i've never had a guitar/bass hit the floor. a couple of warnings here, which have nothing to do with the quality of the straplocks: 1.) you need to make sure the screw is snug in the hole; some people put a matchstick, toothpick, piece of paper or something inside the hole to tighten it up if the hole's too big or has been stripped out; i use a touch of elmer's glue, screw in the straplock, and let it sit for a day. 2.) you have to make sure the ends that fasten to your strap are securing enough of the strap so that it doesn't work itself off the end; use a socket to get the nut really tight. new straps seem to be easier to secure.

Review: their are two issues with these strap-locks that i have come across.the first issue is with thick straps. i purchased a nice leather levi's strap (which i love), but their didn't seem to be enough threads on the lock to fit the strap on. i managed to get it to work by thinning the leather of the strap with a vise. overall it wasn't a huge issue, just a bit annoying.the second issue is actually a very concerning to me. both of my guitars have begun to randomly unclip themselves from the straps and fallen to the ground. not good. i think it has something to do with the metal on the locks getting either bent or worn down, whatever it is i don't like having my guitars fall to the floor.i have these on two of my guitars, both of which are very heavy. it's the first thing i do when i purchase an instrument. they're pretty easy to put on the strap and guitar, and they do securely hold the instrument in place, mostly. i've had them on one of my guitars for over ten years, and on the other for over five.i probably won't change to a different set of locks, for fear of stripping the holes on my guitars, but my next guitar will be getting some dunlop straplocks link removed which seem a lot better and more sturdy.

Review: schaller guitar strap locks work really, really well. however, i had problems at first until i made some changes.- first off, you need to put a drop of lock tight on the threads or the nut will loosen. the blue stuff will be more than enough.- second, the lock can grab the strap pin on your guitar and turn/loosen the screw over time. kinda defeats the purpose of the locks if they hold on to the button but the button comes out of your guitar. so... when i install the new button, i put a drop of epoxy in the screw hole first. never had one unscrew again.if you do those things first, you will never have your guitar strap fall off by accident. ever... but, you can remove the strap any time you want easily by disengaging the lock.

Review: our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago. every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. i had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th anniversary american p-bass...not good. my son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.the problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself. we've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.we are switching to the dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.we tried to make the shallers work but just could not. maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.

Review: i've only had these strap locks for a couple weeks, however, they've performed well so far. the fail proof u holding the guitar is what sold me on these. i would recommend these strap locks over any others currently on the market, but i'm working on designing a better lock.

Review: i bought these through amazon about a year ago and have installed them on all of my guitars. i have both the nickel and black on heavy basses and they have never let me down. i have since installed them on an electric and acoustic guitar out of convenience and purpose. the locks work great and give you an added sense of security.the reviews of the locks speak for themselves and no matter what style of guitar, whether it's a les paul, strat or active bass, i would strongly suggest them. i have never used the dunlop locks, but have heard that some epiphone and gibson les pauls have mounting holes more suited for dunlops.one thing to note is that all of these come with their own longer screws to use if needed. i never had to use them, but they are a nice touch and ended up in the parts bin.

Review: about ten years ago, i installed strap locks on my first guitar (fender stratocaster). they worked well and were easy to install. i subsequently installed dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results: the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation. i had to drill additional holes no two guitars (gibson sgs). ouch.this made me take a second look at schaller. the components, beginning with the screws, are of much higher quality than dunlop. it took me ten years to realize that i made the wrong choice. i should have gone with schaller from the beginning. i have replaced all my strap locks with schaller with excellent results.

Review: i will let you know that i've been using boom stands for 35 years and that i write this so you can make an informed decision. i'm loyal to the audio community and the industry has already put one of my kids through college.i see half of this stand as being just fine but the boom is not very good. i particularly don't think the horizontal axis point is very good, i mean where you adjust the angle of the boom. it's a cheap version of a simple design and i suspect the day will come that you're trying to figure how to keep it from drooping, the problem being that the surface area is much smaller creating less friction and more tightening until something's got to give. the tightening screws to slide it also seem pretty poor and i'd predict someday you'll be going from duct tape to replacing it. i base this more on my experience in sound reinforcement, which is harder on equipment than recording and because i own both types of businesses. the boom in general isn't a nice one and will always be 32 inches because it isn't telescoping and uses a pretend plastic counterweight, so you're mainly purchasing the stand. on stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series.9701b pro tripod microphone boom standjust like you can't compare the price of a used compact car with a new full size pickup, this one is so inexpensive (too inexpensive?) that price comparisons aren't what's important, so looking at amazon today i'd probably buy the 9700ms9701tb teleboom microphone standor this one,dr pro mic stand telescoping boomor maybe try this onehosa msb-521bk mic stand with boomi haven't tried that stand but since hosa generally sells good inexpensive products i'd be inclined to give it a try. i think you'll end up spending more money on your next stand and you might as well do it once instead of twice. i'd pay attention to the 2 and 3 star reviews because you'll find more from experienced users and the most helpful 5 star do not say how long they've been using it but love how inexpensive it is. ignore that it doesn't come with a mic clip because usually they don't, clips come with microphones or can be purchased separately. all but the best stands will fall over when unbalanced, so plan on putting weight on a leg if you're using a heavy mic like a condenser or spending a lot more money. $100+ will buy you a studio boom although a counterweight, like what's used on a cymbal boom will help any boom stand and could be created with a little imagination. as for the cheap cord clips, just forget them and buy these, they'll attach to a stand or cord and work excellent (no leftover duct tape glue).velcro reusable self-gripping tiesbut understand my position, i've got stands purchased 20 years ago that i can still use and don't feel the lowest price is always the best value, but you're intelligent so you know an $80 stand used for 20 years is $4/year, i use stands almost everyday and i don't think this would last me a year and maybe only months. but if1. you don't care about a telescoping boom and2. you don't plan to adjust it much and3. you use a average weight mic or4. you're alright with replacing the boom when neededthis stand could be fine for you now if you can't budget a higher quality stand and it will surely work for some. i did give it 3 stars but 2 are for the product and 1 is for the price. so i hope all of this helps you with your decision. i've now purchased and reviewed theon stage 9701band recommend checking it out

Review: this is definitely a microphone stand for amateur use - it would probably fall apart fairly quick \"on the road\" or if it were adjusted constantly.that being said, it's a great little stand for low duty/home use. i'm using it with a blue encore 100 microphone, which isn't really heavy, but still weighs close to a pound. this stand holds it very sturdily, and with the boom feature, it can be set up in just about any position i would ever need.if you have a fairly lightweight mike and just need something to set and forget, this is a decent stand.and for less than $25 bucks, it's a bargain.

Review: it's perfectly fine for standard, fairly stationary use. we use these at my church, and they get moved around a little bit, but not much. for the price, they are surprisingly solid, and they work perfectly fine.of stands in this price range, this is at the top of what i've experienced.it's easily adjustable, the screws stay tight once adjustments are made, it's light but not so light that it tips or blows over, the feet keep it steady on the floor and from wobbling.seriously, for those who don't need a stand that can handle touring or lots of fiddling around, this is the one to go with.if you need a stand to handle doing live gigs and/or going on tour, shipping around in airplanes or vans, etc., you will need to go up a notch or two in quality (and, sadly, price).

Review: i like mic stands with folding legs (like this) as opposed to weighted bases, since they're easier to travel with. quality-wise, this stand feels solid, but not amazing &#8211; it's a mixture of plastic and metal construction. for the price i paid (around $25), it's a nice piece of kit and everything holds as it should. it also folds down pretty well. note that it does not include any kind of microphone clip or mount, so you'll need to provide your own. the cable clips are a nice touch.

Review: i mean, sure they get the job done, but there're 2 things i'm not too convinced about.. first stability, you have to be very very careful as how you distribute the microphone's weight, and be pretty careful not to rotate it even a litlle bit, otherwise, you'll find yourself with a shure sm-58 with a dent, like myself. and second... i haven't had actually any bad experience with this, but don't seem to be that strongly built. for those 2 reasons i changed to hercules.

Review: this stand is probably one of the most popular among smaller bands, jammers and home studio owners because i run across them everywhere. and like everyone else i wound up with a few of my own. here is what i have learned during the four or so years i have owned and used this model:- for the money they are a bargain and work extremely well in home studios and practice spaces (assuming the areas are not overly cramped.)- they hold up under light gigging and jamming, meaning they are not transported more than two or three days a week.- good stability inside, even with heavier microphones like theblue microphones encore 100 studio-grade dynamic performance microphone. not so good outside if there is a fair breeze.i lost one to stepping inadvertently on one of feet, which immediately broke, and another has started binding when i try to extend or collapse the center pole. those problems are not necessarily quality issues since in the case of the broken tripod it was my fault and not the gear's. as for the binding - i am sure that a good amount of grime has found its way into the tube after four years of use and transporting the stands. had i taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented.for inexpensive stands these are hard to beat. however, i now use theseismic audio - tripod microphone mic boom stand - pa/dj/band/church/wedding use, which i consider to be a superior stand for a small increase in price. also, for outside use or when stage real estate is an issue i have found the old school styleon stage mc7201b round base microphone stand, blackto be a far better solution.

Review: this mic stand does everything it says it will, and is adjustable in every conceivable way. in fact, the boom has a really nice adjusting lever, making it easy to loosen and tighten. the only drawback i found is the tripod configuration of its feet, making it easy to forget where you parked your big feet during live performances; especially when you're emotionally invested and the crowd is urging you on. i would much prefer a round base. other than that, it makes for a great home/garage mic stand when you or your band is just kickin' it. 'nuff said.

Review: i cant play real guitars ....... but i did buy this for rock band. this is perfect with the boom i can sing and play without the stand getting in the way. this has so many adjustment spots no one will have a problem getting a good position with it. i even use it when im drumming. i highly recommend this for real players or even plastic players. well this one is actually better than most of the ones my wifes band has. oh its almost impossible to knock down too, believe me the cats have tried.

Review: for the price, this box works just as well as as any expensive one would. just put in a 9v battery and it works right away. three knobs to control tone, level and distortion to get that perfect sound. i do recommend you get a power adapter, because this eats us batteries like crazy. i accidentally left it on for a few hours and the juice was all dry, batteries are expensive, get the power supply. overall, this is a good budget buy, you won't need to money for quality with this.

Review: what more can you ask for in a pedal that runs you twelve clams and ships for free? this is not the highest quality pedal in terms of construction or tones, but it gets the job done nicely for cheap. if you are just starting to experement with stomp boxes (or you are addicted to collecting stompboxes like yours truely), you can't go wrong with the fab line. i find the placement of the knobs just slightly annoying, but it's a nitpick at this price point. if you are looking for something like the boss ds-1, this will pretty much cover the bases at less than a quarter of the price of the boss pedal. if you are looking for more of a light breakup kind of box on the cheap, get the dano overdrive instead (the silver one). i also find that for about ten bucks more, behringer makes some great clone pedals.

Review: the only reason i'm not giving this one star is that i didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. i got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. we have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. i thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. nope. this pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way. avoid.

Review: this pedal sounds great with my fender excelsior with it's 15 inch speaker and also very good with my 1960's danelectro tweed amp with it's bright weber ceramic 8 inch speaker. i can use the entire range of the tone knob to go from aggressive growls at the low end to screaming lead tones at the other end, and it never sounds harsh. the clipping is sweet and musical, with a sound very reminiscent to cranked amplifier stacks with their front ends being pushed with overdrive pedals. sometimes i feed this with my sd-1 or my danelectro d-2 overdrive and it just puts it over the top. for the price, these pedals are outstanding. the qc may not be perfect, and there are duds out there, but i would say that it is worth the risk, as the circuits in these are just like vintage pedals although they do use cheaper components and boards and such. as long as you dont literally stomp down on the pedal and you dont drop it down the stairs, it will last long enough to make it worth your while. also, the blue led is somewhat bright and annoying, but it is a good indicator so i guess it does it's job. overall, rock on!

Review: the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget. the d-1 distortion effects pedal works great and gives me that mind blowing distortion you would only expect from a more expensive unit... the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is &#34; it tends to be a little noisey &#34; if you turn the gain up too much. you can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have. this series of pedals ( fab ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well. danelectro offers more expensive units but i don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but thats my view!!!. you can't go wrong with this product, danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great...

Review: i purchased this as my first guitar slide. i loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. i almost cut myself! i will never buy a glass slide again, i recently bought a dunlop brass slide and love it. the difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. i would not suggest this to anyone. the metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. there's a reason all pros use metal! the review below is wrong. slides are meant to cover your entire finger, all the way to the tip. you don't bend your finger to play slide. you retune your guitar to an open tuning. just thought i would point that out.

Review: if you want an inexpensive \"pure nickel\" string get thedr strings pure blues pure nickel wrap round core.they feel nice, are nicer to your frets, sound smooth and mellow for the blues or any genre. they bendnicely and sustain just as well.i know guitar strings can be a personal thing, and there are more expensive pure nickels out there, butat this price point try a set of these as well. you may be surprised.i have rated this set at '4' stars because only after about 16 hours of practice the 'd' string windingbroke at the second and third fret of my gibson standard. no damage to the frets and it was easilydiscovered because the string sounded dull, almost dead. strange.i recently went 'electric' again after 20+ years. so electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again. that said, i never had an acoustic wound string have its winding come loose in over 30years of playing.i put another set on my electric and have had no further problems. i have not heard of this happeningto anyone else. maybe its no big deal, so no one remarks on it...update 07/14/2013: i am still using dr blues on my guitars and have not had any further problems withthem..update 01/08/2014: i just had the d string windings break on a new set. different guitar but broke onthe same frets as reported above.

Review: well executed black guitar strap. it is made of strong, seatbelt-like material with excellent stitching that is unlikely to ever fray or come apart. the length adjusts easily to accomodate tall adults or children. it has excellent leather ends with slots cut into the leather to put over you guitar buttons (not-included). nothing fancy but great quality that gets the job done inexpensively.

Review: i ordered with my new guitar. these straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here.

Review: this guitar strap is very stiff and cuts into my neck. also, the &#34;pick pocket&#34; is only useful when the strap is around your neck. when you remove the strap, any picks in the pocket fall out. it is ok, definitely not great.

Review: nothing fancy about this strap, unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end. just well made and functional.i got this for my grandson's squier (by fender) 3/4 size acoustic. it doesn't have a strap button at the top end. it would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut. but i work with leather and i found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose. not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand.

Review: so, you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing. this strap is perfect, even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well.the materials are 1)high quality soft nylon for the strap - it feels kind of like a non-stretch ace bandage, 2) durable non-scratching/marring plastic for the links and adjuster and 3) a thick rubber material for the ends.the thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well. they do not slide of the strap pegs very easily. i say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility. again this material seems to be non-marring.all this and a secret compartment for picks.overall, a fantastic product with a price that can't be beat. highly recommended. five stars.

Review: i recently purchased two protec guitar straps in order to avoid having to switch straps between instruments. these straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here. these are also a nice medium width, so they should be suitable for all kinds of players. although one reviewer complained about the size of the holes for the strap buttons, i actually find the snug fit to be an advantage: it doesn't feel like i'll have to worry about the strap coming disconnected from the guitar. and, the price is right.

Review: i have enjoyed my protec strap. i was surprised how well made the leather harnesses are and i have had no issue with them stretching on the strap posts of my dot studio. one note would be that these straps are probably better for your lighter body styles - strats, teles, sgs - heavier guitars will tend to start digging into your shoulder after an hour or so. having the pick pocket is a neat feature. i am just finishing up rebuilding a lp copy and i will be getting another for this guitar net week.

Review: pro tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments. their low cost black nylon guitar strap, is a well constructed high quality item, that is a top seller at amazon. the large sized attachment tabs are quite thick, about 1/8 inch. although the fit on the typical guitar strap nuts is snug, some type of strap retainer would still be recommended. black works with most colors, and this strap should last for a long time, but it is so inexpensive, if you qualify for free shipping, you might want to consider ordering a spare.

Review: nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern. it fits my ovation quite snuggly, i bought some retainers, but found them unnecessary so far. i couldn't remove this strap if i wanted to, well i could but its just too much work. so it will stay where it belongs for a few years at least.the only thing i don't like about this strap is the edge of the strap is a bit abrasive on my bare neck. not a problem in the cooler months when i'm prone to sweaters and such, but in the summer it takes a bit of getting used to. it's made of a canvassy cotton, so its strong, but its also a little rough. i'm going to try waxing the edge with canning wax or candle wax and see if that smooths it down a bit.it is a very nice strap and will last years. i like it almost as much as my 40 year old ace strap, which is much softer due to 40 odd years of use and abuse by a multitude of musicians. but finding an old ace for anything close to this price is a fools journey.buy one, then keep your eyes out for a hootenanny. you'll be ready.....

Review: i purchased this cable to use for a multitude of purposes around my home studio and within my live rig.i am a bass player by trade, though i dabble with many other instrument (as many of us do). i typically run direct for recording and have lately been foregoing a bass amp for many live shows, when the sound system is adequate, via sansamp paradriver or vt bass deluxe di.around my modest home studio i often need an xlr to run just a few feet from my di to my interface so the at cable works well there. for being a thin flexible cable, i notice no noise issues or interference problems.i also sing backups on stage and i typically run my mic into a tc electronics mic mechanic pedal, (which is great for those of us who do not have outboard effects processors for our vocals) and then to the mixer. i use the at 10' xlr to run from the mic to the pedal and it allows just the right amount of cable to be routed securely for the show, then i run the standard xlr to mixer or stage snake out of the tc.the cable end are very rugged feeling and have a very solid feel when connecting and disconnecting equipment, unlike many of my other cheaper xlr cables. this cable, at least in its 10' form, sounds just as good as my mogami silver 25' xlr. i know that many cheaply priced xlrs are noisy and problematic. i have several. i don't have to worry about those problems with this cable and will be purchasing more in other lengths as well to compare to my mogami cables.on short, i would recommend it for any budget conscious musical professional or novice alike.

Review: since this is the third hanger i have purchased it goes without saying that i really like it. my only criticism is that it ships with mounting hardware that is for a &#34;brick&#34; wall. i am fairly sure that 90%+ of those of us that use these hangers mount them on a plasterboard wall. how about shipping it with a suitable wall anchor for drywall? otherwise, a great hanger that i trust for use with my expensive guitars.i'm just running out of wall space and money for new guitars.

Review: this is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people. great for people with babies/toddlers looking to get their guitars off the ground like myself.i love the unique self-locking mechanism that it has. the weight of the guitar lowers the hanger and moves the lock levers up so your guitar neck is securely fastened. i have an electric and an acoustic hanging up. the acousitc's body is about 4.5\ review ers said the included drywall anchors are cheap and not that good. the wood screws that came with the product i found to be a little short (if you were installing on dry-wall in front of a stud). others found this to be true too. i bought #8 wood screws in 2.5\" length at the hardware store and these worked perfectly for my install. the included screws i think are about 2\" in length or a little less.

Review: i was first exposed to the hercules locking mechanism when our praise band leader brought in his hercules two-guitar stand and i tried it with both my full-size 12-string guitar and my 5-string banjo. i was impressed. when i decided to buy some guitar hangers to reorganize my music room/amateur studio, i was excited to find that the same hercules mechanism was available in a couple wall-hanger models. i put them on my wish list, where my son & daughter-in-law found them and bought three for me for christmas this last weekend. i just finished putting them up and i'm completely satisfied with their solid construction. they give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably. i used the provided screws, which worked great for mounting them on the plank walls. i probably wouldn't trust the hollow wall anchors provided for drywall, but instead get something more substantial to mount it (like a toggle anchor).what i'm happiest about is that these hangers can be used with a variety of stringed instruments. the opening is wide enough to accommodate my classical guitar and 12-string guitars but not so wide as to not support my 5-string banjo. (i've submitted a photo showing them holding up a classical & 12-string guitars, and 5-string banjo). my friend plays gretch semi-hollow body and fender solid-body (and other) electric guitars with his hercules 2-guitar stand, so i assume they would also work with the wall hangers.i am happy to recommend this handy little device to anyone who wants to get their favorite instrument up out of the way but still keep it handy.

Review: i had purchased a peak violin stand but wasn't thrilled with the height of the violin bow holder -- the tip of the bow dangled just a bit too close to the floor for my comfort. this, being designed to hold either a violin or a viola, allows more height and i feel that the bow is safer. additionally, this stand allows my violin to be placed on it with the shoulder rest in place while the peak stand was less secure unless i removed the shoulder rest. so this stand is more versatile for a performing situation and for days at home when i want to have my violin handy and ready to play as time allows.warning -- do not use any violin stand at all if you have a cat or dog which can come into the room where the violin is resting on the stand. the stand does have a lock to help keep the violin on the stand but it would be very easy to knock the whole thing over if a dog or cat were in a playful energetic mood.

Review: i've two of these stands. on one of them, the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld. if you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand, you'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there. mine lost its weld, so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - i was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor!update: 1/9/12 glen ingles refuses to replace or repair the stand. beware! ...and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in..............wait for it................china. that may explain why it failed, but glen ingles could have offered to replace it. i guess he doesn't want me to buy any more of his products, or refer others to his products. well, that's his policy. that's okay, he's got competition, and i'll be purchasing from them instead.

Review: i play in small tight places.. sometimes, people dance right in front of us.. i actually bought one of these for my partner because for some reason, he would put his stand high and only use 1/3 of his boom to hold his microphone.. the rest of his boom arm stuck out into the crowd and because it was so tight, drunk dancers would bump into the boom part of the stand knock his microphone into his teeth.. despite me telling him that he should just adjust his boom differently, he wouldn't and would continue to get annoyed by the drunk dancers.when i saw this, i thought it would make a nice christmas gift.. he does use it in the one place that he has problems but only here for some reason..i bought one for myself as well and i do like it.. the plastic piece that holds the extruding part to the other side of the boom does not stay in though.. it comes apart quite easily.. my only complaint..what i do love is that the teeth on the boom angle that connects to the stand holds the boom and it doesn't slip down at all! i personally love that because i have had boom arms that &#34;go limp&#34; and their is nothing more annoying!!

Review: i use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic (a cheap sm58 wannabe from radio shack). i like how i can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use, but then i can easily position for use with a generous 16 inch reach. definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk, but a clamping mount works very well. the locking clutch is excellent, with a large nob and secure teeth. the smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient. just what i needed.

Review: wuhan makes great products for the money. i have the 18&#34; medium crash and so i decided to try the 16&#34;, both are great cymbals for the buck. if you close your eyes you would swear you were using a zylgian from the 60's or 70's. nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals, with any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great, so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it, the 18&#34; is a bit warmer than the 16&#34;, the 16&#34; sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the 18&#34;, bought 4 wuhans, the 16&#34;,18&#34; 21&#34;(ride) and a 12&#34; splash. will review each one as they come in from amazon. why the 4 stars?....well its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close, if your on a budget like i am, go for wuhans. i have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years, this is a really good product and excellent 16&#34; crash. wuhan really impresses me. there are some great video's of wuhans on you tube, you should really check those out before buying wuhans, or any cymbal for that matter. i am very pleased with this 16&#34; crash!

Review: i purchase a set of these, and first off, the case itself is worth 10 dollars. it is a quality heavy cloth case with a felt/velvet lining. the harmonicas are almost unbearable to play as soon as they arrive as they reek like plastic and oil, but after leaving the case open 2 days, they barely smell, and they are still airing out. i love how light they are due to the plastic cases, even if they aren't super loud. they are a great buy for the money, as i simply wanted a cheap set to mess around with and try out different keys. the notes are slightly difficult to bend, but the reeds are still loosening up. all the notes play but a few of the higher ones needed a little encouragement with overblowing and lightly breaking them in a little, but the harps all sound great after 5 mins of break in. i am quite happy with the product, and they honestly could be much worse for the price. the blues and set is only 10 dollars more with metal casings and probably better components, but these were good too. i would recommend to anyone who has a decent harmonica in c but wants to experiment with other keys... good buy

Review: tried these on a laguna acoustic guitar. they are basic standard traditional strings. they sound good, they are light weight. on this guitar they sound a bit too bright. my preference is to use elixirs, prefer the feel and sound on this guitar (elixir polyweb acoustic guitar strings (light)).these strings do not last less time than the elixirs. mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar. some people like a brand new set before every gig, others will go weeks or months before changing. if you are an every gig person, well the martin set is probably perfect for you - they are much less expensive than others. leaving strings in for an extended period - elixirs or other coated strings are probably a better idea.there is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar. the choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play. i think the martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style. so for the price, these are an excellent value.

Review: s, i moved to these light/medium strings from the light gauge. they do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge. however, i noticed one thing that has driven me crazy. finger slides are much harder with these strings. the lower strings (e, a g) just don't slide as easily until there is some buildup in them. as a result my fingers get out of position and don't hit clear notes until i've slid those areas a couple of times. that's probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them. the packaging was also a bit confusing. since there are two strings to an envelope, it seems i too easily get the strings reversed on set up. other string makers i have tried, color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up. overall good strings and i'll probably buy them again.

Review: by definition, medium is an in between size. but when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium. on that scale, these strings would be above a literal medium. for me, the guitar is not an everyday instrument. i don't typically spend five hours a day with one, and sometimes go weeks without picking one up. but i do have periods where i will spend many hours a day playing and don't want something that will kill me.medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me. light and custom light are easier to play, but can make a higher end martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line. for me, these light-medium are exactly where i want my strings to be.if you like martin's medium, find them a bit much at times, but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones, you may find that these are a great choice. i don't feel i am missing anything compared to the medium. if i had two identical guitars with new strings of each type, i would probably find differences in a side by side comparison. but without that, i don't think i'd notice the difference with normal listening. with the lighter varieties, that would be far from true.if martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1% milk of strings, these light-medium would be the 2% that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste.

Review: these acoustic strings are used on a laguna acoustic guitar. they are just the right weight, and just the right amount of flex. we've tried d'addario, brighter sound (d'addario acoustic guitar strings set, exp 80/20 lite), and martin, a little stiff (martin strings sp phosphor bronze 12.5-55 msp4150). in the end, these elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar.the difference between these strings - nanoweb and polyweb - the nano's have a very light coating that you almost don't feel. so if you like standard not coated strings, the nano's are probably the way to go. if you want a bit of softness, the polys are a better bet.as has been said, there is no perfect guitar string for everyone. the perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar. for the combination we have, these are outstanding strings.on the strings lasting longer, that's hard to say. fresh strings do sound better. it's clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non-coated strings. but i'm not certain these last so much longer. we buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them - playability. corrosion or crud on the string isn't the sole factor in changing strings.elixir is a wonderful company. on my third or fourth sets of elixir strings, the g string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time. elixir is outstanding, they will replace any string that doesn't perform up to your standard.the other amazing thing - i've watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings, and i'm still very confused. the elixir website (it's pretty simple elixirstring dot com) is outstanding. ther is a two part video from the taylor factory on how to change strings. i swear that if you follow those instructions, you will change strings in minutes. it is so simple and so reproducible. i love this technique.

Review: i only play elixir strings. they are relatively finger friendly, hold their tune well and are much longer lasting than many strings i have played in the past. these were for an electric acoustic i just bought, which is why i got a lighter string than i normally play. i will move to mediums once i get the feel of the guitar. of course, they will be elixirs as well.

Review: elixir's nanoweb light phosphor bronze strings are the best strings i've ever used on my alvarez acoustic -- a guitar i've now owned for over 30 years. they certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there, they have a nice punchy tone, and are easy on the fingers. unlike the elixir extra lights that i found to be lacking in bass and just a tad on the mushy side on a short-scale guitar, these seem like an ideal combination. i may buy another set soon and restring the short-scale instrument with lights. compared with some brands and gauges of more \"old school\" strings, there may be a little less bass response, but these sound good, pretty even through the set, and the convenience of not having to change strings so often outweighs whatever minor issues that one might have with the ping of the low E string.

Review: polyweb strings have a heavier coating so i prefer nanoweb for the ultra-thin coat and brighter sound. they're easy on my fingers and make the most beautiful sound. because they're coated and have anti-rust, they last up to months longer than regular strings and don't make much finger sounds. favorite strings.

Review: dont be cheap. take it to a guitar shop and ask for a full tuning for new guitars. the low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that. if you are doing more than just finger-picking, you might want to add pick-shield. my wife used it for some naked newborn pics and the guitar got most of the compliments which i had very mixed feelings about. if you play mostly standing, this is the guitar for you. if you sit down, it slides out from your lap alot due to the curve of the back. but it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar. good structural integrity thus far. my newborn is now 15 months and its is holding up nicely considering how many times she has gotten a hold of it. i really should get a case.

Review: no Doubt.... it's not a really exceptional guitar but for the money you get more than you should. first impression of the guitar was terrible. i took it out of the box and started to play. the neck had a huge bow in it. the truss rod was completely loose. i had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable. i'm not sure if it was just my guitar that wasn't set up or if that's the way they come. if they come with a loose truss rod then this guitar is not for a beginning player as properly adjusting the neck is best left to someone who knows what they are going. once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned i was pleasantly surprised. the guitar sounded pretty good. the neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric. action was good. upper fret access is really good. the guitar stays in tune while playing. plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises. the bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch. i expected red paint. i would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting. they are a little small. $175 for a roundback is really a no brainer. if your a beginner or have some playing experience you will enjoy this guitar and the value it offers.

Review: this instrument might actually be in a class of its own. that is, it would be extremely difficult to find a guitar in this price band that comes even remotely close in terms of quality; not only with regard to craftsmanship, but certainly the sound it produces. the applause exceeds expectation whether it is unplugged, amplified, or even run directly through a mixer. beyond sounding comparatively spectacular, it is far more durable than perhaps any other hollow-bodied instrument on the market due to its components and design. the electronics are reliable and the instrument is accessible, or playable, to even the most novice of musicians. this guitar is the ideal instrument for a beginner or a younger musician, simply because it is cost efficient, durable, and as easy to play for the price as one might be able to find anywhere. even experienced guitarists will almost certainly appreciate its action, sound and durability if not only for the purposes of practice and travel. this is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument.

Review: these strings fit the bill perfectly for \"my\" desired sound from a yamaha lj-16 acoustic guitar which has been \"doctored\" with bone saddle, pins and nut. when i decided to put the money into the guitar, it was my belief that the elixir strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that i like so much in the lj-16 and after all the work was completed......that proved to be true to form. i did move to the medium for a little improvement from the bass side and it's a most outstanding sound from a medium price, hand crafted guitar. elixir has the best (most comfortable) feel, to me, of all the strings that i've tested and these provide the best (for my liking) sound on this guitar. try them if it's quality sound that you're looking for..............these are great!!!!

Review: i have had a korg ca-30 tuner for a few years which i really like.I wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit.initially i bought a boss tu-80 for more money, but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the korg tm-40,and the batteries rattled around in their compartment.also i like having the middle green led for tuning.the price here can't be beat and it's a well built item that works great.i was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much, but they take more pressure that it would seem, and there is a delay until it turns on or off, so that turned out not to be an issue.i am not real hot for the color, but it's nicely made and works well, so i will live with it.i especially like the little folding stand in the back, rather than having to find an old credit card.

Review: i have it for more than 6 months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome. i have another tuner, which is set eadgbe, that is much easy to tune without any confusion. although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently, it's confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left & right +/-20 or more. however, it's a bonus for using the tuner, and i don't have to bring all to the classes. for the metronome, which is my initial purpose to purchase it, it's great and have enough adjustable calibration, 13 beats, rhythms, and tempos for practices.

Review: i am quite pleased with this product. it's relatively inexpensive, small and light weight. it operates on two aa batteries (included). i use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate. the led and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily. i should have ordered the cm-100 clip-on tuner at the same time (placed a separate order later) to allow to tune in a noisy music (jam or band) environment. you can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings. there is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches. the metronome is pretty loud for the small size. i have a hearing loss, so if i can hear it, even while playing, it must be pretty good. the speeds are from 40-208 bpm. you can select between two modes pendulum step (preset values, 40,42,44---88,92,96, etc) or full step which allows you to change incrementally by one (40, 41, 42---206, 207, 208, etc). beat tap allows you change the time signature from 0-7 beats and also duplets, triplets, quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats. it has a 1/8\" mini earphone jack for private use. it is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously. i bought mine from austin bazaar. shipping was free and fast. i give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration.

Review: as an acoustic guitar player, i think this is a great product.i had previously been using the korg ga-1, which is a fine basic tuner. the ga-1 works like many basic guitar tuners, where you designate the string and it shows you the note in standard tuning (or with one, two, or three flats). but the tm-40 works by just showing the pitch you're currently playing among any of the 12 reference pitches - making alternate tunings and open tunings much simpler.now i use the tm-40 at home as my main tuner, and the ga-1 rides around in my case. both great products.

Review: pros: it's a good tuner, it's a good metronome, and it's a great combination package. the flip-out stand on the back makes it easier to see than when it's lying flat. the metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program.cons: the buttons on the front are raised on top of other raised areas, and it's too easy to accidentally turn the unit on. the tuning sound activated once in my pocket while i was sitting in the audience at a band contest. also, unlike the ca-30 tuner, this one favors higher notes strongly over bass and makes it difficult to tune low instruments in a noisy environment.also, it quit working suddenly after about a year. other people i know who've had this tuner have complained about lack of durability.

Review: dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and i have used the standard model for some time. it seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.i used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while i was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.later i wound up trying the humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a dreadnought, i took to putting the dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a planet waves microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it. then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. worked great.so i ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. they now ship without the clips. company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though i didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. more importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when i pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. so i sent it back to amazon for a refund. no problem getting the refund, but i'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.if you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the om model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else.

Review: dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years. i think that i can safely say that the basic design looks to be amazingly similar to what i remember when i saw these for the first time in my university days of the late 1970s. generally, dampits can be used over and over for years. sometimes the rubber becomes discolored, sometimes the rubber rips near the end of the dampit, but basically this is a very workable way to maintain at least a minimum amount of humidity in and around your instrument, something that is especially important during the winter months when artificial heat zaps the humidity out of the air. this is the first instrument-specific dampit product that i've ever purchased and it seems to work exceptionally well. in addition to the standard dampit, there's a sound-hole cover. in case it is not clear just how it works, the clear sound-hole cover has a short string with a loop on the end. you simply attach the dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar. my first impression is that it does an excellent job of keeping some needed humidity in the body of the instrument, something very important on a solid-top classical guitar. i would recommend this over the standard dampit because the sound-hole cover is so convenient (hopefully it will continue to keep me from having to fish around inside the guitar for a runaway dampit) and seems to keep the humidity focused in an area that is especially in need of it. a must have if you keep your acoustic guitar in an environment that gets much below 40-50% humidity.

Review: recently i switched from a blackstar ht-5 to a fender mustang iii v2 amp. although the fender is a great sounding amp, you don't get this natural warmth that you get with tubes there's this liveliness that's missing. so, although my cleans sound good, they aren't great. although my overdrive sounds good... it's not great. although my distortion... well you get the picture.since adding this pedal was less expensive than buying a new amp i decided to give it a try. this pedal adds the same kind of sparkle to your sound that you would get from using a clean boost on a tube amp. i believe some people call it &#34;pixie dust&#34; ... that little bit of magic that makes your sound come alive.interestingly enough, i don't leave this pedal on all the time. but when i stack pedals, or use certain effects like chorus, a shimmer reverb, or any effect with the exception of maybe a leslie... it's pretty awesome.it works different than an eq... and if you have a tube amp - a clean boost may do the same thing... i think it really adds life to solid state amps.

Review: it's hard to really describe what this pedal does- it doesn't distort, flange, echo, or produce a chorus. i'd heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it. and because words don't do an accurate job in describing it, i would have probably never pulled the trigger on one (even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go). as luck would have it, i acquired one on trade, and i have to admit that i agree with the whole blanket euphemism. this stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my blues jr. when placed at the end of my pedaltrain- right before i run into the amp. i don't feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amp's tone, though i do believe it works even better in a loop. i placed it in the effects loop of both a palomino v8 (usa/ampeg made) and a crate vc508 (a 5 watt usa made el84 tube amp with celestian speaker) and it was transformative to both amps' tone (in a great way). it does very well with single coils. it's a pedal that i would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in. i don't think it works as well when i run my lp into a jet city combo - particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures / harmonics. that amp also lacks an effects loop and i imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase. i guess it's rig dependent, but it's a keeper for what it does to the sound of my fender.

Review: i like it. this is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments. like all other pedals, it's not \"The pedal\" (seems like you always need another one). but it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone. after you've settle on a setting you like, it adds a subtle, but noticeable addition to your sound.

Review: this pedal essentialy balances out the high, mid, and low frequencies yout instrument produces. i also have the software version of this effect on my daw. this pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone. when i switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier. i highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians.

Review: for those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky, bitey blues material (think albert collins), this will likely add a little, and i mean a little, extra oomph to your sound. it sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling. but you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a hughes and kettner statesman 40 or 60 watt amp, too, just running it straight.to me, from what i have heard, it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music. it definitely doesn't add any more fatness. so my overall impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get out of copper bracelets for their arthritis or feeling better with an increased vitamin e regimen. in other words, this is a matter of what is in your head and how suggestable you are.most musicians already use eq and reverb and by careful tweaking of those two things you can obtain what you think you're getting out of this pedal, i think.

Review: i'm not going to do any explaining about the review on how the pedal affects your tone. this definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the bbe sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal. to the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone. essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.the lo contour knob doesn't \"increase\" the amount of bass produced by the amp. rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone. to the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't. you're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.the process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies. these frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.that's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better.now, i gave this product 4 stars not because i've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect. at first i almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off. with time i've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a \"night and day\" difference.i recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better. this pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack. it won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.in conclusion, though i definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the \"must have\" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone. this is a pedal that i leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones.

Review: this pedal adds that \"i don't know what\" to your sound.i chased a sound for years until buying this pedal - what a difference.if you have great, top quality cable, quiet amps and pedal boards, shielded guitars, fresh tubes - you know the drill - you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head - then you plug one pedal in and whamo!! - there it is!it was this pedal for me - just turn the knobs until \"it\" comes out of your speakers.a must have - especially if you are playing clubs, bars or arenas - you have a pedal board - and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front - give your notes clarity during leads - make overdriven chords ring.i like this pedal - it's on my board - and it's never coming off.

Review: back in the 90's i used to have an ampeg guitar head with an effects loop. i discovered the rack version of the bbe in a music store and was amazed by what it did for the money. the amp i have now is a totally bad ass fryette deliverance 120, but sadly it has no effects loop. so i thought i was out of luck as far as a bbe goes, because as far as i knew they were only available in rack mount units that could not be placed anywhere but in the effects loop. then i was looking for pedals on amazon and, lo and behold, there was a bbe sonic maximizer pedal! i snatched it up with a quickness and i am very pleased that it sounds just as good as the rack version. one caveat- if your signal is noisy the bbe can actually increase your signal noise. for this reason i highly recommend using top quality patch and instrument cables and doing all you can to clean up any noisy aspects of your sound before you use it. this pedal is very subtle, but to an audiophile like me it is absolutely essential. it also works great for any instrument or sound system. it's also great for vocals as well. but you may want the rack version for those applications. i would also buy the rack version if i had an effects loop to run it through. imo, the pedal is really only for those folks who have no effects loop but still like what the bbe does. i'd go with the rack just for ease of use and keeping it in the proper place in the signal chain. plus you can get a stereo rack version and have two bbe's for not much more money that you can use for another application.

Review: i've had this stand for about 5 years and have used it on stage for the last 3 years pretty steady. the first thing that broke was the piece that keeps that upper shaft from pulling all the way out of the base when you extend it - the disclaimer here is that it was very cold and i immediately extended it to the maximum point always letting it hit the collar to stop it. it's plastic; plastic and cold don't mix - the retainer piece broke and went flying and i was standing there with my guitar stand in two pieces right before a gig. i managed to get it back together but now i have to be very careful when extending the neck. the other part that i've been having problems with is the upper collar that mounts to the top of the stand and holds the guitar necks. it has come up completely off and i must continually tighten that hex screw to prevent the top from falling off. i won't mark this stand less then 4 stars even with those issues because it really is a great stand. another person noted to pay attention to your guitar dimensions, which is very good advice. long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod.

Review: just got my stand today... the quickest delivery ever with the super savings free shipping selected that i have ever experienced! go go, amazon! lulz anyhoo, i have two banjos and a mandolin that i purchased this for. i looked about for quite a bit at various sites, reviews, prices, etc, and pretty much hercules got the best reviews everywhere (although admittedly i hadn't really wanted to shell out over 50 dollars). yet this tri-stand really looked good with a solid general review, and i am rather tight for space overall (think trailer home size). i wanted a way to hold my instruments in one place without having to work around gig-bags or hard cases taking up limited 'living space'. as it stands (figuratively and literally), the hercules tri-stand does the job excellently with the two banjos. all three instruments are varying heights, the resonator bluegrass banjo being the longest, and (naturally) the mandolin being the shortest, with a open back clawhammer banjo in the middle.the three 'back-rest' fold outs are static, attached to a center ring, and you \"can\" adjust them independently a little up and down , but not to compensate for such a length difference between a bluegrass banjo and a mandolin. however, the mandolin is a really lite thing, so i suspect it will be fine just hanging there by the peg head without a 'back-rest' as long as the stand isn't jostled around. in my own case, aside from two rather lazy cats and pending no sudden hip-smash-oops by me, that shouldn't be an issue. and of course, considering i am looking at a possible third banjo, the mandolin may just go live in its case after all...now a word about open back banjos, if you are considering this stand... first off, no, i was not going to rest the coordinator rod against the 'back-rest' (just seems like a bad idea). what i ended up doing was adjusting the 'back-rests' so the resonator of the bluegrass banjo rested about an inch up from the bottom, allowing the open back to rest on the other side on top of the rest, along the lip of the banjo rim, at the edge of the rest foam where it begins to curve out and down. the tail-piece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing. seems pretty solid in this position while still engaging the weight clamps up at the top.i give it 5 stars mainly based on the excellent quality of the stand and the fact that it is the only three instrument stand worth any kind of hoot i have been able to find. its not the absolute perfect thing for my own application (would need the three 'back-rests' to be independently adjustable in height for that), but overall i am extremely pleased with it.

Review: if you are like me and truly value your (usually) expensive prized instruments, then you want to make sure nothing happens to them, accidentally or otherwise. the hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest. they have a better base design, and even when the stand inevitably gets bumped there is no wobbling, no worries - just make sure you lower it all the way, as it is designed to be.these things are awesome. also, everything fits so perfectly on hercules stands. all of the other tri-stands lean your instruments in toward the top too much and cause the headstocks to bang together. not here, plenty of room for everything now. this stand (and the double version which i also own) lets your gear hang down perfectly straight and protects it all with those very thickly padded stops you see near the base in the picture. also, the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet. with all other stands i am always worried that my guitar will slide off, or if it gets bumped that it could fall out. this mechanism holds it tight until you want it, and releases it very easily and naturally for you, but will not let it go while it's just sitting there. check these things out, you will not be disappointed.also, as for durability, i have used and abused my hercules stand for years, tossing it around my car to play at different places. it's been tossed, dropped, setup and stowed many times and it still looks and works just like it did when i first bought it. it doesn't even have any obvious visible scratches on it (it came with a bag but i discarded it and never used it). meanwhile, i had gone thru dozens of regular cheapo stands over the years before i bought the herc. i will only every buy herc stands from now on.

Review: this is one of the cleanest sounding mini-amps you'll find. mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones. it uses jfet components which get close to a tube amp sound. it does sound tinny through the 2\" speaker, but am radio sounded just as bad through 2\" speakers. i hated it at first until i plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the o. drive knob. very clean but i could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitar's volume knob. turning the o.drive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle. of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp. i'm building a speaker cab with a jensen 6\" speaker just for this amp. according to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab.

Review: after reading numerous reviews talking about the exceptional volume and tone of this amp, for the price (about $16-$17) i had to try it.when i plugged my acoustic into this, i was very pleased to find those reviews are accurate. first, let's not expect $500 double 16&#34; sound from a portable 9v amp. once that reality is recognized, it's realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price.i would note that the sound you get out of this amp-- as with any amp-- will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you're feeding from. i tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different. one had very rich tone, another sounded &#34;tinny&#34;, another had a passive pickup and required i turn the honeytune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup. so it won't sound the same on every guitar.that said, if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good, this amp is simply awesome. i've had it only one day so i haven't put it through the test of time... but first-impressions are that i will buy more of these in the future (i need more than one portable amp).my sister visited and heard it right after i opened the box, and she was impressed as well. neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp. and i have to say, the aqua color is major retro. gotta luv it.i've been looking for &#34;the&#34; portable amp for some time. this is the best i've found to date and the value for price is a perfect balance. i don't know as i'd pay the $40-$50 for this guitar shops often ask, but the amazon price is perfect. : )one last thing: danelectro branded 9v battery included, same color as the amp. priceless.

Review: brough this for trying \"electric\" feels on the acoustic guitar, and don't want to waste too much money on electric acoustic (preamp) guitar or big amp if i don't like the \"efeels\". after researching awhile and reading tons of good reveiws of it, i decided to give it a try. i didn't expect too much on $20 amp, but surprisingly, it positively gives me more than i ask for. i also brough it with the adaptor, which is great to save $$ for long runs, and i don't have to worry about the battery for home practices. it is adorable out of the box; it looks like a lovely toy, but it works professionally based on its 10w amp. i don't care much about the manufactor's suggested modes, basically, i just fool around with the three button controls to whatever sounds i like in different songs on guitar / uke. i like the small size that won't take too much space on my tiny room, it's cute to look at, and it is practical too!i had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when i used a poor pickup; however, when i changed to another one, i can turn the volume as high as i want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup. i almost thought that was an issue from the amp, luckily, i have two different pickups to try it deeply. after using the better pickup, the amp doesn't have any issue yet. i have used for few times, so i don't know about its longevity yet!one more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar's sound itself won't be muted, but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp; anyway, it's a great feature to have.

Review: it's not going to win any awards for sound quality, but it sure is cute. as you might expect, it's a pretty boxy sounding little amp, more reminiscent of 60's portable transistor radios than a double stack marshall. but it did the two things i wanted it for. first, it has a belt clip, which i can attach to my belt or a guitar strap. second, it has a headphone out, so i can plug in a set of ear buds (1/8&#34; stereo jack). you can get it to a clean decent practice room level if you keep the drive control set at minimum. surprisingly, the drive control works it's way in gradually, letting you control the distortion a bit with the guitar volume control. with the drive control cranked up, you can get the amp unexpectedly loud, but terribly distorted. for something you can throw in your guitar gig bag and take with you wherever you go, it's not too bad. with a set of earphones, i would put it on par with some of the more expensive amp-jacks that are available. if you plan to use it as a practice amp and you're not moving about, i would recommend getting a power supply (will use the same ones as most effects pedals). battery life appears to be around 3~5 hours, but the performance starts degrading at about an hour's use.

Review: i wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors -- but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands. there is of course, very little bass response with this one and it is a tad tinny, but hey, it's just a 9 volt battery. i just wanted the guitar audible for practicing outside and this is a very neat little device. they put a lot of thought into this amp, and it is outstanding for the budget price. keep in mind, you can patch another 9 volt powered device through this one to enhance it -- i will at some point run my boss digital delay box through it to check that out. the belt clip on the back and triple adjustment dials are nice, and i got it in red as a change of pace, because i always get &#34;black&#34; with my equipment. it looks very nice and the vintage front design gives it a lot of character. nice product, danelectro.

Review: ok i've owned 2 of these danelectro amps. for one they are cheap in price, loud in output, and can be used as external speakers when attached to computers via wired or with purchase of a cheap bluetooth adapter from ebay or amazon. recently i purchased this item on ebay for $10 - bluetooth audio music receiver v3 wireless stereo adapter for smart phonesnow i can connect to my tablets, smartphones, and computers and use this amp as a great external bluetooth speaker. plus the battery life is great. try to buy a bt speaker on amazon with this wattage that's cordless and works from battery power, and you will spend well over $200.the included battery is worthless and dies in about 5 minutes. i installed a 550mah rechargeable 9v battery (ebay) and it lasts forever.plus i can still use it as a lower quality jam amp when i want... for this price its hard to beat.

Review: this micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one. and it is not a toy. don't be misled by the price--this is a real amp based on stompbox electronics, and while it may not be a marshall stack, it is more than adequate as a highly portable practice amp as well as a performance amp for small spaces. it is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments.i bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice. to this end, i use the belt clip to mount it on my hip. then i just patch in my mike, twiddle the controls, and go to town. the tone has been fairly pure although, with a mike at least, i can also get some pops, crackles, and squeals. this is pretty typical for anyone amping a harp, so the honey tone is not at fault. in general, this amp is pretty forgiving of the input. i've used it with a high-impedance mike (astatic jt-30), a low-impedance mike (behringer xm8500), and electric guitar (fender stratocaster). it handles these without noticeable signal loss.what is this amp exactly? my guess is that danelectric took the circuitry for its overdrive stompbox, added a 1-watt amplifier circuit, and put the whole shebang into a retro case. the result is quite appealing. and the overall look and feel is one of quality. the case is solid albeit plastic. the three controls (volume, tone, and overdrive), while not detented, have the smooth control that you tend to get on better components. the input 1/4-inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid. someone in danelectric had a sense of humor in touting the unit's \"leather\" strap, though. it is more decorative than useful.if you can operate an overdrive stompbox, then you know how to work this amp. the volume control is obvious. the tone control alters the bass/treble mix (but not very significantly, in my opinion). the overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion (again, not to a great degree). the instructions describe 16 \"sounds,\" but someone in danelectric has a sense of humor. otherwise, why label one setting \"send the cats under the bed.\" ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you.as i said, this is small but really not a toy. i've personally found it very useful in practicing blues harp because it's so easy to set up and so ridiculously portable. and when i decide that i'm good enough to panhandle in penn station, this baby is going with me.

Review: i cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp, i was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound, instead i couldn't put it away, i must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe, the tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing,i would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp, the 9v battery holds up well (which is surprising considering the drive you got off it)so spend the $20 0 and get something that is a real deal, i hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one

Review: i wanted to like this. i really did. the idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;perfect&#34;. however, the unit i received was cr@p, and i'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. the one i got kept cutting in and out. you might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. and when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. frustrating.i did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. the so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. bummer. any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?cheers

Review: i've tried several &#34;portable amps&#34;. for the price, the honeytone can't be beat. it has volume, tone and overdrive knobs (the overdrive can go way too over, so easy on that one). comes with a battery but can be connected to a 9v adapter (important note: reverse polarity, negative central). interestingly i have found this amp seems to work significantly better with acoustic-electrics or piezo-based pickups better than magnetic pickups. but for a small, portable, light-weight practice amp which one can hook to a belt and attach an earphone... they don't come much better. it has a belt clip on the back but you'll have to supply your own earphones and 9v adapter if you want them. battery is included. of course a guitar cable is a required extra.well worth the money.

Review: i'm giving this one 5 stars, with the caveat that you must get the silver aluminum one, otherwise the black thermoplastic ones do break. the thermoplastic ones broke on me within 2-3 months of use, 3 different ones, until i got the silver one which has not had that problem. every music store i go to locally has the black thermoplastic ones, and they look in disbelief at me when i say they break. but they did --if i leave it on the guitar on a fret for 5 or 10 minutes and go into the kitchen to make tea, the thing literally snaps and breaks into 2 or 3 pieces and goes airborne at high speed in 2 pieces, and could poke someone's eye out in a public performance, freaky. there's something about the rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure and/or temperature fluctuation that does it.i live in northern california, so i don't know if a dry climate like the southwest would not have that problem.the silver aluminum one by contrast, hasn't broken in now nearly a year of use, and shows no hints of doing that. it feels different in the hand from the thermoplastic-- no hint of plastic, but it is very light and not heavy like the g7 ones are. i made sure to order the silver aluminum one through amazon, since the description on the black ones say some are aluminum and some thermoplastic, and i only want to make sure i get the aluminum one.the silver aluminum planet waves capo really is the best capo i've ever had, super easy to use, very easy to put on and switch from one fret to another while you're going from playing one song to another (you don't have move your body or the guitar like you do with all other capos to put it on or move it, which is a spectacular design), it keeps the strings in tune better than most other capos, and it's out of the way of your hands, doesn't interfere when you play any chord. the screw adjustment is in the perfect place for the least strain and doesn't hurt the fingers when turning it. it's the least obtrusive and best capo ever. i'll also add that i have an old carpal injury so i want the least strain, and small hands, so i want the least awkward and most light capo, and this does that. i absolutely love it, and i'm glad that the aluminum ones are durable.

Review: it does a good job for it's primary purpose as a capo so i gave it four stars. it works flawlessly, but the one minor annoyance is that it doesn't easily stay on the head of the guitar except above the nut where if you screw it a bit tight it could mess with the tuning of the guitar. with clamp on capos you can just clamp them on the wood.

Review: this is a fantastic little capo. i say little because it is not as big as the spring loaded type, of the shubb capos i've used.it has a low profile, and i can reach right up to it and still play well.it seems to be sturdy and well constructed, and i love that i can easily adjust how much tension to put on the strings. just enough so they don't buzz and then the strings will stay in tune when the capo is off.much cheaper than the g7th, and does the job just as well in my opinion.for everyone saying that you can't fit it on the neck, make sure you get the right capo! if you have a classical guitar, get a classical capo! if you have a guitar with a really thin neck get the lite model capo. if you are like most people who have regular size guitar necks, get the normal one.don't write bad reviews of the product because you bought the wrong kind.

Review: i don't have a classical guitar, but i just got an inexpensive but really fun steel string guitar with a non-radiused fingerboard. i've also got over a dozen capos (don't ask!) but all are for radiused fingerboards.the fingerboards of most steel-string guitars--electric and acoustic--are radiused, that is, they are not flat. they have a gentle curve to them, so gentle that many wouldn't notice it unless they looked closely. look up \"fingerboard\" in the wikipedia for an excellent discussion and google images for diagrams and pictures.even though the curve is gentle, if a fingerboard is radiused, a capo must be curved, too, or the outside strings would not be pressed down properly and would buzz. if a fingerboard is flat, like a classical guitar's, the capo must be flat, too, or the center strings will not be pressed down properly and will buzz.if you're not sure whether your guitar's fingerboard is radiused, slide a ruler between two frets. if it lies flat, then so is the fingerboard. if it rocks, the fingerboard is radiused.i really like this capo because of the way pressure is adjusted by turning the tension screw. this makes it possible to exert just the right amount of pressure--not tool little, which would cause strings to buzz, and not too much, which would cause the instrument to go out of tune.as others have noted, its one drawback is that it can't be clamped to the headstock when not in use. but for that, i'd replace most of my capos with radiused versions of this capo. highly recommended!

Review: this is an awesome capo! it's sleek, light,easy to install (you can do it with one hand) and looks nice on the instrument. i use the ns capo on my gibson sg special faded and it does exactly what it is supposed to do. i love the dial, it's very easy to use and lets me set it to the just the right amount of pressure where i can still bend the strings but there is no fret buzz. awesome product, much better than using a kyser that puts your guitar out of tune and leaves gouges in your neck. sounds great on my sg and my acoustic.for those of you wondering yes it does clamp on the headstock if you tighten it down enough. i think it also depends on the width of your headstock but it works for me.

Review: there's nothing not to like about this capo. i have two of them. i've played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos. i like this one's low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard (by turning a knob to tighten it) rather than rely on a spring, as on the clip-on type. it takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip-on type, but i like the results better.

Review: i purchased a classical guitar and only had a traditional (steel string) capo available to me. not thinking it through i used it on my nylon stings and after a few times i realized it had damaged the string to the point they had to be replaced. along with my string order i added this capo so it does not happen again.pros:it's small and lightweight.it's very well made. it not only looks great but also appear to be of high quality.It's very adjustable. unlike my steel string capo, this uses a screw/knob to tighten, not spring loaded. this allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stings.it works on steel strings. yep, i found my self needing a capo on another guitar and only having this with me, i saw no reason it should not work so i gave it a try and it performed wonderfully. i won't be using it full time on my steel strings, but great to know in a pinch i have use it.if you need a great capo thats gentle on your nylon strings then this is the one to get.

Review: i ordered one of these because i like my other planet waves capo a lot (i believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;lite&#34;). however, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a martin jumbo acoustic). it will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.i'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. it doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as i can tell. unless i just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, i wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.my recommendation is the classic kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). if you are looking for the screw-down style, i would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;lite&#34;.

Review: a little history:i have been a guitar player for forty-odd (some of them, very odd) years. for the first thirty of them, i tuned by ear - starting by guessing at what a low E sounded like, then tuning the other five strings by fretting, listening and tuning. i could never understand why the tuning often sounded perfect for one chord, yet remained `off' for others... it took quite a long time to get it right. then, about ten years ago, i thought i had figured it out. the problem (i thought) was that my guesses at a true \"e\" were off - so i got myself an \"e\" tuning fork (320 cycles) and used it to tune the first string. then, i did as i had always done - fretted and tuned the other five. not much better as a result - kept having to tune and retune for quite a while to get all chords to sound right. during those years, i tried tuning all six strings to (what i believed was an accurately tuned) piano as well as by ear to tones available online. nothing gave me better tuning on the first try. then, i saw an ad for a chromatic tuner and lightening struck.the realization:there have been many - each of which has led me closer to what i have now - near perfect tuning on the first go `round! first off, i realized that when we say \"e\ that is not just one note. it is a range of literally hundreds - perhaps even thousands- of specific tones. the same is true for every note. this is akin, i guess, to the realization as a child, that no matter how many shades of `blue' are in a box of crayons, the chanced of having the precise shade you want for a specific drawing are rare. purchasing my first chromatic tuner (a ct440, manufactured by switchmucic and sold through musiciansfriend.com) moved me a long way along the continuum of learning and accurate tuning. however, that tuner had at least two limitations. firstly, it's construction is rather light and flimsy - it works ok, but has a second limitation that conaused me to buy the korg (for about the same price) that is that the korg has a built in tone generator and speaker allowing the option of tuning that way rather than having only the single option of having tones made by the instrument read and metered back to you. both tuners have plug-in for electric instruments, and, so far as i can tell, their accuracies are similar. i prefer the korg for the reasons i have mentioned. additionally, the korg can be manually recalibrated for special tuning needs - and `remembers' the original tuning/tones so you can return to it for more `standard' usage. a nice, extra piece of flexibility. the lcd meter is easy to read and colored lights tell you, right away, whether you are sharp, flat (and by how much!) or right on!as a point of surprising interest, the tuning fork i had used for years turns out to be profoundly flat! a shock to me - given that i had grown up learning that tuning forks gave off perfect tones! i have saved it as a reminder that all things are not what they are promoted to be. i guess the round pitch pipe that ms. sweeny used to tune up the class in the 5th grade was probably not quite as precise as she would have presumed!and finally:this is a marvelous little (and inexpensive) device - well constructed, accurate and flexible to allow for many different tuning need situations and circumstances. i assume that there will be still higher places for my `learning curve' in this area to rise to - but for right now, this is it. i am using it, regularly, on all my stringed instruments (two six-string martins, a twelve string epiphone and a frailing banjo. the time it saves tuning the 12-string alone makes it more than it's own price!)if you have not discovered chromatic tuning (maybe i really WAS the last one to discover these things!?), i suggest you do so immediately and spend your time enjoying the pleasures of making music rather than sitting in frustration trying to adjust the tunings by ear so it sounds `really' right. perhaps people with `perfect pitch' can do very nicely without a chromatic tuner - i am not one of them. are you?

Review: this is a nice little tuner. it is small, easy to read and use. it has a non-backlit lcd display of an analog vu style meter, with extra marks at plus and minus 20 cents, and red leds that light when a tone is sharp or flat. it has a green led and large mark for being on target. it has a built-in mic for acoustic instruments, and a mono 1/4 inch phone jack for electric instruments. it has an active tone you can switch on for tuning, but that is only adjustable over the narrow range of 410-480hz. it uses a pair of aaa size batteries that you pop the whole case open to change. if you have any vision problems, the display might be an issue. the lcd is about 1 1/2 inches long and 3/4 of an inch high, and, like all non-backlit lcd displays, has a narrow viewing angle and reflection issues.i wanted this for tuning didgeridus that i was making, and it works adequately for that. the one thing it is lacking that disappointed me is a frequency or octave readout. as it is, it gives you the note and cents sharp or flat, but does not give an octave number or frequency of the sound. so, you know you are tuned to a c, you just don't know exactly which c it is. probably not much of an issue if you are tuning a regular instrument, but in some cases would be very handy to know. i suppose with more training and experience, i could learn to tell that by ear. (what? learn a skill! isn't that asking a bit much?)i suppose for an inexpensive tuner, that is the trade-off, but it does detract from the usefulness of this tuner for my purposes. other than that, it seems to work well. it is consistent, easy to use, and compact. i consider it about average in value - it does the basics well but is missing what i consider an important function in such a device. i may be expecting too much for the price, as i have not done an exhaustive study of tuners and their specs. having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three.in any case, if you don't need to know the actual octave or frequency but just the accuracy of the notes you are tuning, this works quite well, and is not very expensive.

Review: "unixreviewtime": 1269734400, "reviewtime": "03 28, 2010"} name mildcritter review i've had two of these tuners. they are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners. they're durable and have a long battery life. unlike most other tuners, in noisy environments they don't lock in on higher pitches before lower ones, again a plus for low instrument players.the one problem that i've had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to a-439 to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as a=440. strange.

Review: i bought this bench on an amazon warehouse deal so that i could get it on prime delivery and was not disappointed at all. the bench is very sturdy and comfortable - the cushioning is thick and soft. the item arrives flat packed and can be adjusted to the correct seating height in seconds. this bench is just what i was looking for and i'm sure it will serve its purpose for many years.

Review: it has a comfortable seat and seems stable and well-made. however, if you need to haul it around frequently, it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat. also, if you need to adjust the height, you have to remove the entire bolt assembly seen at the crossing point of the bars, and then select one of three holes that are only an inch or some apart from each other. so, not much selection there.

Review: this is an iconic fuzz pedal. yes, smashing pumpkins used this pedal but corgan also used a fender blender (which is similar to the big muff but has an octive thing going on too). this is not a subtle pedal. it's cuts through the mix well if you are running into a cleanish amp. i find that it gets a little muddy if i run it into an amp that's already breaking up. i can say the same thing about most fuzz pedals though. this is not a wooly, splattery vintage tone like the dunlop fuzz face. it really has it's own thing going on. it's not the kind of pedal that i keep on all the time, but it's a cool tool for the sonic toolbox. if i had it to do all over again i would likely buy the big muff with the tone wicker switch. it's about ten bucks more and has a little more tweekability.

Review: i have played through this for over 15 years and i will tell you right now, get a big amp. get 2 amps and split the signal, even. you want to have the biggest amp you can when using this pedal. otherwise it will come off sounding frail instead of \"frail and bedazzled\".otherwise this pedal conjures up a beastly reference, and it should. i have been in a couple bands where i just plugged this into the amp and played my riffs. the free drinks and loose women followed shortly thereafter.if you're looking for stinging yet rumbly fuzz, this is the pedal you need. i only wish it went up to \"11\".

Review: i owned this pedal for many years, before finally trading it in on some other equipment. it produces one sound extremely well, but it only does that one thing. the sound it does very well is the late 60's/early 70's fuzz sound: \"white room, black curtains\"; \"satisfaction\"; \"ina gadda da vida\". note: this pedal produces very good sustain, but has really bad attack. as such, it will not really do the \"whole lotta love\" sound. as i said, it does one thing very well, but its range even with classic rock is quite limited. if you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound, this pedal gets you 100% of that sound. if you want to also cover other classic rock, you're gonna need at least one more overdrive/distortion effect.

Review: there are a fair number of similar tripod guitar stands out there for about the same cost. if one of your pet peeves with some of these is that the u-shaped support falls out when you carry the assembled stand around, then you'll especially like the world tour stand. the way that the u-shaped piece inserts makes it far less susceptible to falling out. and, although it is, as one other reviewer put it, \"minimalistic,\" this stand has a substantial feel to it. i'm quite happy with this purchase, and would buy another world tour again, rather than one of the other brands that i own. amazon.com did a great job, too, getting this out to me.

Review: ers mentioned. just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it won't bother anyone and it's fine after a day or two.one last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock. i did not know this but wow i had no idea how useful that could be. i tend to carry my guitar, in bag, up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful. then you have the backpack handles as an option as well. i really cannot recommend this bag enough. i do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like, but i don't really care, the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that, and while the padding is great, i would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel. it would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage, in case you want it for that kind of thing. i don't travel long distances with my guitar but if i did, i would use a hard case only for that as i have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines lately.hope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear!

Review: this is a great bag, regardless of cost. the fact that it sells for less than $20 makes it an absolutely fantastic deal. (free shipping only makes it that much better.) unlike some other reviewers, i have not noticed any objectionable smell. i will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed. the fabric itself is a heavy cordura material, the zippers and pulls are heavy duty too, and the padding is stiff and thick enough to afford your (solid body) guitar some very substantial protection. (i would estimate the padding, which is entirely concealed within the cordura, to be approximately three-quarters of an inch thick.) in addition to the main carry handle at the side, there is another in back, at the top, as well a pair of backpack-style straps, so finding a convenient means of carrying your guitar shouldn't be any kind of an issue. the two zippered accessory pouches (for picks, a spare set of strings, and perhaps some music) are also a nice touch. in my opinion, this bag could easily sell for twice the price and still be considered a bargain. as it is, it's very cheap insurance for my epi les paul ii.

Review: i bought a pedaltrain pedal board and i have 6 individual stomp boxes that are crammed onto it. i originally bought hosa connectors and they are high quality and have a low profile, but the selection of lengths is limited. i bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to re-do the board. i swear i was done in 20 minutes!! the board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length. these cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality. the supplied cutting tool works as described and the only thing you need is a small-tip, flathead screwdriver with a medium size handle so you can firmly drive the locking screw into the cable for the final step. i could have saved some money if i had just bought these first instead of a bunch of random length patch cables.

Review: the good thing about the cable station is you can make your own cables at custom lengths so you can have a neater pedal board without the need to solder the connections in place. all you have to do is cut the cable flush, insert it into the \" plug with a twisting motion, and then turn the setscrew on the side of the plug until it is tight.as a benefit, if there is a shorting of the signal all you need to do is find the offending cable, remove the plug, cut the cable, and insert the end back into the plug.great right?well, not really.As far as reliability goes, nothing can really replace the connection that is properly soldered. with the money you spend, you could easily get a decent soldering iron, some old cable, and some cheap plugs from radio shack and practice. in the end, you can by bulk cable and connectors and make them as needed.i have used this product and had to re-cut several cables at different times but only to cables that have been constantly moved around. the other ones that are more permanent haves not given me trouble, but i have experienced problems in the past. always have a few spares that have been tested.another annoying thing is that they give you more cable than connectors, i would think 15 connectors would be more sufficient.is it easier than soldering? yes.are they reliable? for the most part, yes.will i continue using the product? yes, because i usually have spares.why do i use them then? i'm lazy.this is from the cleartone cables website about gold connectors:don.t waste your money if you are being asked to pay extra for gold plated connectors. the thin soft gold (5-10 microns) .flash. plating looks cool, but scrapes off easily and the brass aterial underneath stops you from seeing that the gold has worn off! the brass eventually tarnishes and causes crackling when the plug moves or twists in the socket contacts.it is true that gold is a very good conductor of electricity when mated with a gold plated socket. but the sockets inside your guitar amplifier and guitar are not usually gold, so there can be virtually no benefit to gold plated plugs.

Review: i am a tech as well as a guitar player. i also have spent time in the past teaching soldering. but these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections. most of us know by now that there's a lot of hype but it really comes down to good quality cable (this seems to be) good stable connectors (these seem to be) & the connections between the two that last (time will tell). all i know is i have hand soldered special plugs with good cable to only have them break with use and i expect the same with these especially in a high use situation where they are plugged & unplugged often.- i do know these are signal clean & do not bleed f highs & that is critical in my book.- they are very Easy to use & can be done on stage between or before sets very quickly and with no Soldering & i love that!i will definitely use these again unless i find a longevity problem.lm

Review: what can i say? i started out with a couple of pedals, then a wah, then more, then a board for them, and sooner or later all those 6&#34; cords are either in the way, too short or whatever. i do like the male-male offset connectors to bring pedals together but sometimes on a board you've got odd distances. this kit does the trick, and truly was easy to use. only once did i create a plug with a bad connection and had to redo it.

Review: i bought this to replace a folding stand that was just not strong enough to hold up under the weight of some of my guitar books. this stand works great for me, and hold even the largest of my music and tab books.the construction is much better than other portable stands i've used in the past, and has two great features that i really appreciate. one is it's height adjustable, and two is the tilting head. the tilting head is a real bonous on a portable stnad, and this one works great.for the price this stand is a great buy that i would recommend to anyone, but being primarily a guitarist this stand is execptional. with the page holders tilting head and height adjustability this is one of the best stand purchases a guitarist can make.

Review: of course, this stand is not nearly as solid feeling as my much-heavier, solid-metal music stand i use at home. it does twist around a bit when you handle it. on the other hand, it's much lighter, collapsible, and it goes inside my practice bag instead of being a piece of furniture that takes another hand to lug. for my practices and rehearsals i want to travel light. this stand fits that bill, and its desk angle is adjustable so it works well for large fake books and for a single lead sheet. i had two pieces of thin plexiglass cut at my local hardware store to sandwich separate sheets of music so i have no problems with wind or with three-sheet-wide scores. i've never had a sturdiness problem with this stand, and i've never had it tip over, but i am careful not to tighten the knobs more than necessary, and i set the legs to their sturdiest position. i always play sitting, so height is not a consideration for me. but i have measured it and found that at its highest elevation the bottom of the sheet music is 50\ review s are two or three years old, and i wonder if this stand was the same design then that it is now. it is a lightweight stand and i take care with the knobs, but i certainly would not call it flimsy.one discrepancy that might be important to you: the stand they delivered to me this month (october 2011) was not a \"two section\" stand, as advertised. it's all in one section and it collapses down to a 20\" length that fits in my practice bag. i actually consider this a plus since it makes it quicker and easier to erect at rehearsals. i bought one of these hisonic signature stands a few years back, but they've changed it a bit. that one definitely was in two sections, and i made the top section into an excellent table-top book stand. that older one also had folding-clip-type clamps for each section instead of the turn-knob-screw-in type of clamps.

Review: great slap echo sound. do not buy this with the expectation that it will act like a digital delay- it's closer to a reverb. it provides an echo sound similar to if you were playing in a room covered in tile (an old engineering trick!). great for old school rock and roll, rockabilly, chicken pickin etc. this will fatten up the sound of a dry amp. as with all fab pedals, i find the knob placement slightly annoying, but at this price point you can't really make a justifiable complaint. construction quality is somewhat cheap but the knobs feel solid and it has not failed me in more than a year.

Review: this pedal works but doesn't have the depth of echo i expected. i doesn't even come close to the same sound quality of my old dan echo de-1 pedal. that certainly explains the difference in price. you get what you pay for. i'm using it with a fender eighty-five solid state amp. i tried it with other amps and it sounds the same. if you're looking for a good slap echo effect, i would recommend spending more money and buy the dan echo de-1 pedal or even the danelectro blt slap echo pedal is less expensive than the dan echo, but still sounds better than the fab echo pedal. the fab echo pedal works and you can hear a definite difference with and without it. it's just not as good as i expected. i'm sorry i bought it and i don't recommend this pedal. there are much better ones on the market. shop around.

Review: these fab pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre, but i bought this on a whim to use with a fender tube amp and it works well. as other reviewers have stated, the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it's not abused. i use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects.i have found that the delay works well around 50 percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay. i don't know if i would gig with this pedal or any othe fab pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments, but it serves it's purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect. i have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future.i have alot of other pedals and i tried this pedal with a jazz bass, with some eq tinkering, i found a good mix of echo. i originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a d-4 and thought it would be a good idea. again, danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay, but this is a good deal and was $100 dollars cheaper than my electro harmonix memory boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp.

Review: i've needed one of these for my fender amp, yes i used to spend time dialing in the delay pedal for the rockabilly/blues numbers and if my settings got messed up, well, that would slow the show down. i wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didn't. this pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy. really quick to setup and use. it's not a delay unit, it's not versatile either, but what it does, it does perfect!

Review: the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget. the d-4 slap echo effects pedal works great and gives me that old tube amp reverb sound that you would only expect from a more expensive unit. there's no fancy bells and whistles but just good old manual adjustments that lets you dial in the sound you want with no effort at all.. this series of pedals ( fab ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well. danelectro offers more expensive units but i don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!. you can't go wrong with this product, danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great...

Review: i'm sure this isn't the best echo pedal (or even in the top 100), but it serves it's purpose fairly well. stacking with other cheap danelectro pedals will degrade your tone but it isn't something that most of us can't live with. for 14.99 us it's worth taking the risk imhoupdate: the pedal gave up the ghost (died) in a relatively short amount of time. i replaced it with mini modtone type delay.... i actually like the dano sound better, but the modtone will do for a slapback and it is built way better.

Review: i admit, i was really just curious how good a $15 pedal could possibly be, so i figured i would try one out. i had played some danelectro stuff in the past (a baritone guitar and an amp many years ago) and remembered being satisfied with their stuff. anyway, i figured since the pedal was so cheap, why not try it out.you know, it is a pretty decent stompbox. the slap echo is a good enhancement effect, meaning, it isnt really over the top....just gives you a mellow, reverb-ish echo...not quite delay, not quite reverb...kind of somewhere in between. i have since added it to my stompbox set up for that little something different. not bad at all. i cant speak to battery life though, since i use an adapter combo to power all my effects. for kicks, try it out with some distortion and/or overdrive, and a wah....anyway....enjoy!

Review: i bought one of these pedals 3 years ago, along with some of the other danelectro pedals in this line, and was happy with it. the sound i get with it is very, very cool. after a while it just stopped working. while i was disappointed at that moment i just ordered another one the next time i was online. you can't beat the price. if it does stop working after after a few years of use, you aren't looking at paying $90 or more for a new pedal. all of my other danelectro pedals are still working just fine so it may have been a fluke in the electronics or i just used it to death. an electrical engineer friend and i took the pedal apart to try and fix it but decided it wasn't worth taking up our time since i could replace for $15. so i ordered another one. definately get an adapter for this. yes, it's casing is plastic but quite sturdy. just don't jump on it like you're trying to put out a fire when turning it on and off. guitars and effects are the tools of a musican's trade not the hammer and nails of a builder's. think about getting a 1 spot adapter so you can chain several pedals to one outlet. if you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals...well...i'd suggest buying them by the gross. any effects pedal made by any company is going to eat batteries like a stoner eats potato chips. used alone or with other effects, the danelectro fab slap echo effects pedal will be sure to delight your auditory kinesthesis.

Review: i picked up this behringer ct100 cable tester because it takes the guesswork out of maintaining a cable collection. the unit does its job very well and it helped me find several bad cables that i previously thought were ok. it is well built and sturdy. the bottom of the tester has sharp metal corners and screws that could damage a wooden table. i suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside.although the machine itself is good, the accompanying documentation is awful. it presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack. for example, it does not include illustrations of how the lcd readout should look when a cable is good or bad. i had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram. as it turns out, the behringer ct100 is an inexpensive knockoff of the morley swizz army cable tester. the manual for the morley unit is available online and it has diagrams that make the testing easier to understand.

Review: idiot-proof, compact, extremely sturdy. all metal enclosure with good quality jacks, simple to understand led readouts. runs on 2 aa batteries.features that set this apart from the slightly cheaperpyle-pro pct10are:-'test tone' function which sends a known volume signal down the line. very helpful in level adjustments down long chains of equipment.-'intermittent' issue indication - this is what made me choose this model. if there's even the shortest dropout, the leds indicate it. intermittent issues are the most annoying and can be difficult to troubleshoot.my only complaints:-the a small screw holding the battery cover on stripped immediately when initially inserting batteries. it was like carving a bar of soap with a knife. quite frustrating. used my dremel to change it from phillips into a slotted screw, and managed to get it out.-there's an included belt clip that attaches with two screws on the back. this clip blocks access to the battery compartment, which is ridiculous. luckily i have no need for the clip. i used one of the screws intended for the clip as a replacement to the stripped battery cover screw.-no rubber feet on the bottom + metal enclosure + battery cover screw = sliding around and marring whatever it sits on. i stuck some re-purposed rubber feet on the bottom.after the few 'problem solving' situations mentioned above, this thing is a 5 star product. too bad they couldn't go the extra step to make it 5 star out of the box.

Review: for the price, it's worth it i guess. if you just want to try it, go for it, that's what i got it for. it sounds nice and adds a cool tone to my setup, but after playing on a few more expensive chorus pedals i would suggest saving up if you really need a chorus pedal. but for the price it's not too bad.oh, and the casing isn't like a wimpy plastic knife plastic. it's pretty durable. albeit don't throw this on concrete and expect great results but it could stand a few stomps.

Review: i mean you paid 15$ for a pedal that if you want to buy from the boss it's about 6times this price and if you want it behringer it's about twice this price. it does what is supposed to and it doesn't have a cheap look. for home and garage entertainment is good enough. i was trying this pedal before i buy any other pedal from the same brand, but now that i know that i like it i'm going to buy the distortion (red) one. i'm only sad they don't make a noise gate or something similar. that would be the top of the deal.

Review: this puppy sounds fantastic. the controls allow the effect to be adjusted from very faint to over the top chorus with deep and intense sound. the controls are on the front, as are the in/out plugs, so it is a little tight when adjusting the knobs. very reasonable pricing. uses a 9v battery or 9v adaptor. it has a retro look and an old school sound, perfect.

Review: the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget. the d-5 chorus effects pedal works great and gives me that soft phase shift you would only expect from a more expensive unit... this series of pedals ( fab ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well. danelectro offers more expensive units but i don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but that's my view!!!. you can't go wrong with this product, danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great...

Review: yes, this pedal is made of plastic. yes it is inexpensive. but don't be fooled- unless you really mash on the switch button like an idiot, or over torque the battery cover screw too hard with a screw driver and strip out the plastic threads- it is pretty tough and durable. the chorus effect has plenty of adjustment, tone, and depth. it may not be a boss pedal, but for $15.99 you are getting a tremendous value and it sounds very good. i was so impressed with these inexpensive pedals i now own 4 or 5 of them. as a hobbyist guitar player who does not want to invest hundreds of dollars into multiple effects pedals- i am into 4 or 5 of them plus associated cables and a power adapter for about the same amount than i could buy one boss or other high quality pedal for.i would also recommend buying the danelectrode 9v power adapter if you use multiple pedals. you can also buy a 5 gang power cable and daisy chain up to 4 or 5 pedals from the same power supply to make your own pedal board. if you have multiple danelectro pedals it is a clean way to tie them together. i also bought some short 6 inch instrument cables and daisy chained the pedal inputs/outputs together so i can have mixed effects, or have each one independently.these pedals have been used almost daily for a couple of months now and i have not had one issue with any to date. a few other guitar player friends that have tried mine out are also very impressed by them. absolutely a 5 star value!

Review: got this little guy last night to use with my squier tele custom ii, hooked it up and played around with it for a while and it really impressed me for the quality of effect you get for nearly pocket change! i also have a digitech rp-50 that has multiple effects including different types of chorus and this fab chorus sounds better than any of the rp-50's chorus settings. i am so looking forward to laying down some cool tracks using this with the tele, my applause acoustic/electric, and my squier vintage modified 70's bass guitar. and like other folks who've bought this product, i'll most likely be getting some of danelectro's other fab boxes and the dan electrode power supply.

Review: the danelectro fab series is supposed to be everything we hate about effects pedals. cheap. mass-produced. housed in a plastic casing. but the fab series offers affordable effects ($15 to $20) at surprisingly good quality, and end up sounding as good as some pedals that cost 3 times more. if this pedal cost $50, i might gripe about how tight together the input/output/9v jacks are. i might also complain about the weird position of the mix, speed, and depth controls on the top of the unit, or the small footswitch. but at this price, for it to sound this good, i can't complain at all.don't expect the fab series to be good at everything. but if there's and effect out there that you only use once in awhile (especially anything involving modulation or delay), the fab series is going to do it well, and do it for a fraction of the cost of other pedals. it's just a great option to have for casual/budget guitarists.

Review: i got the $50 standard black on black case. the case arrived within 2 days via ups during the middle of the christmas rush! wow! very fast shipping and it was adequately packaged and there was no sign of the box being abused in anyway. regarding the item itself, i am bit lukewarm. i have a $500 washburn and wanted something more than a gig bag for going to and from gigs and practice sessions. and i got that. its lightweight, plenty of room in the gear box and on top of the guitar head. however, the fit is a bit loose and i don't have the sense that this case will stand up to much abuse over time. so if you have a pricey guitar or are planning to load you guitar in a truck with other gear, or might ship your guitar or take it on a plane, this case is not the one you want to buy.

Review: guardian? well, it is padded, but i've only gigged once since having the item (with 3 rehearsals held prior) and i can say that the case is nicked up \"pretty good,\" as they say in the south. yes, it will last, because it is a guitar case, but there's no way there's enough security to protect an instrument on a plane. now, that's for flight cases to handle, but don't even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case, because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the \"guardian\" fails to guard against crushing your hardware. this item is not one of the better cases out there, but it does suffice, and it does look good. the first day i got it, someone said, \"nice case, it looks great!\" say that now, though, after using it outside the house 4 times, and you'd be a lying sob.

Review: this is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in china. i bought it to replace the original (chipboard) case for a 1963 gibson es-135 archtop. lower bout is 16&#34; wide, upper bout is 12&#34; wide, body is 21 &#34; long, and it's about 5&#34; deep at the bridge. fits very snugly in this case which is what i was hoping for. the case is about 4&#34; longer than the top of the headstock but i didn't expect an exact fit. the wood shell is thin so don't drop anything on it but it is also lighter than a lot of other cases. normal plush fake fur inside with about 3/4 of soft foam all around. black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay. this is not a case to take on the road or if you travel by air but it is adequate for casual use. only annoying thing: the case arrived locked. the keys were, of course, inside the case. dumb. a friend at a music store used a key from another guardian case to unlock it. a good reminder that the case latch lock is to keep the latch from popping open and not to keep crooks out.

Review: great foot rest, it's not flimsy. but it's not light weight. i put it in my guitar bag to carry with me and i definitely feel that it's there. i like that it's adjustable to various heights. i am short (5'1\") so i usually have it on the highest setting to prop up my left leg when i'm playing classical guitar to get the guitar at the right angle. but i sometimes adjust it down when i switch it to my right leg and when i'm playing flamenco and rather than rest the guitar between my legs like in the classical posture, i shift it over to my right leg. i ended up getting a 2nd one so that i keep the one at the highest setting for when i'm playing classical, and then the other one at the lower setting for my flamenco playing. great foot rest, i recommend it.

Review: the other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built. they were right. it can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it's put. one of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where i play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack - probably around half of the thickness of a chord book, although heavier, as it is steel with a rubber tread on top. it feels like i will own this for a long time - a well priced, good value.edit2/2013after owning this for around a year and using it every day i find that it still looks and works like new. i recommend it highly.

Review: i've uploaded customer-supplied images above to show just how much gear one of these is capable of holding and how small the stage or studio footprint is. when you factor in the price it's plain to see that this rack is not only a bargain, but a flexible platform for mounting components.one other characteristic that the images reveals is this is not a table-top only rack. they work very well on the floor.the rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank. i have a bass amp head and a power amp, plus a power conditioner in one of my racks that, combined, weighs around 50 pounds. the rack is not stressed or strained by this weight, and could probably hold another 50 pounds safely and reliably. another plus is it comes with a bag of high quality mounting screws for components, eliminating that expense (i was expecting to have to orderraxxess rack screws with washers hardware (pack of 25), which turned out to be completely unnecessary.)My only complaint is the rubber feet caps easily fall off, but a little glue rectified that rather trivial problem.if you need portability, reliability and value for smaller gear suites that are frequently moved (such as setting up on stages) this is an ideal solution for rack mounted equipment. i am so pleased with mine that i intend to purchase another one, bringing the total to three.

Review: for years i played the original cry baby, the vox wah, and others i can't remember names of. i was always on a quest for a good wah sound that i just couldn't find. i didn't want to spend $600 on a wah with a rack. so at the recomendation of a studio engineer i purchased this wah about 5 years ago. i am very pleased that i followed that advice because this pedal really has the range of wah i was looking for. the greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable. the user dials in the frequency sweep they want. the volume boost is a great feature when you need to play a lead over the live mix. i recomend this wah pedal over all the others, especially the signature series wahs because you can get the same sound out of this unit with a little tweeking.

Review: first of all, i love the crybaby 535q and i recommend this wah pedal. i will tell you my wah pedal story.several years ago, i bought a crybaby gcb-95 and, even though i did not use wah very much at the time, i think it was in the shop twice to get repaired within a year. fortunately, it never gave out on me during a gig, but it was only a matter of time. finally, i gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely.a couple years ago, i bought a digitech xp-100 whammy wah, mainly for the whammy effects to learn how to do morello's style. since it has some digital wah patches was available, i started to use them too and was happy because it doesn't have a treadle that will break like on my gcb-95. the wahs were usable, but just did not sound as good.finally i was supposed to play alice in chains, \"man in the box\" and the digitech was just not going to cut it. so, it was time to get a real wah. i searched around on youtube for demos and talked to people to see what they used. i chose the 535q because people told me that they've never had a maintenance problem with them, and it is very versatile.You can get several kinds of wah sounds by tweaking the dials,and they have some great suggestions in the manual to get started. i set mine on the cantrell setting and have left it there because i mainly use the wah when playing early alternative 90s hard rock styles. that setting works will in songs like ratm, \"bulls on parade\" as well, including to create the white noise for scratch dj sounds.i still do not use wah pedals terribly often, but it is nice to have a reliable wah that can do whatever i need it to by simply adjusting a couple knobs. i think that as long as i need a wah pedal, this one will suit my needs in many styles, and i think it will remain on my pedalboard for years! it is definitely one to consider, and the price is not that bad.

Review: i know most budget guitars don't come with cases, most not even a gig bag anymore. that's the trade-off i guess in the internet age in order to keep costs down. even my fender standard telecaster came sans-case and i had to coax the salesperson to throw in a gig-bag as an incentive but even that was back in the day. i had not looked at guitar gear in so long that i didn't think about guitar cases until i got the itch to get a new six-string and came across these. they look great, seem well built(i am not a professional touring musician) and apparently do the job.the exterior is covered in black tolex, just like a pricey case, and the gold stitching and plush interior really make this case seem worth much more than the asking price. the storage compartment is adequately sized and there's a simple lock that would only be functional as a safety measure to ensure it stays latched. there are brass feet on the bottom and along the edge to keep it level and prevent damage to the case. it fits both my mim tele andsquier by fender deluxe stratocaster maple neck, pearl white metallicperfectly and i suspect it will do a fine job protecting them.i will be picking up a tweed version for the telecaster to match up with the style, and my lovely fender amp. like i stated, there's no longer any excuse for not having a good guitar case.

Review: this is better than a gig bag, for sure, and looks like it could hold pretty much any standard sized solid body electric. now, it's not padded really well and doesn't look like it'll hold up for more than a few years, but it was cheap. it seems to be slightly off kilter at the hinges and requires some fidgeting to get the lid closed properly, which is why i drop a star.

Review: i've bought three of these now - this is an awesome, well made case that fits just about any superstrat guitar easily. the most recent was for something rather unique (a fanned fret, compound scale eight string) and that guitar also fit perfectly with plenty of room to spare.there are more expensive options out there, but for a non-fitted \"do it all\" case, this is the best bang for your buck hands down. i am comfortable using it to carry any of my guitars, from the inexpensive ones to the high end customs. great case, great price.

Review: the pyle \"battery powered pa system with wireless microphone\" is surprisingly well made and has features i would have expected on much more expensive equipment. we run workshops, often at our customer's locations, and needed a portable pa system that could easily be transported and doesn't require a lot of power. here are my observations:+ long battery life - worked for over 4 hours straight, but can be connected to ac to work as well+ wireless microphone - built into the system, has good range, and acceptable sound. battery included.+ inputs for 2 microphones, 1 guitar, and 1 audio connection - each with it's own volume control+ portable - built in retractable handles and wheels makes moving this around very easy+ includes a mini-plug to 1/4\" converter - a handy accessory+ includes echo effect - a fun adjustable effect to liven up your voice (my kids loved playing with this :-)note: my unit shipped with one of the fuses in a bag and it needed to be installed before the system would work.this unit worked much better than expected and is a great value for the performance of this small sized unit!highly recommended!

Review: it's really not a 200w system. the booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and i doubt it is really even that powerful. the wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it. my shure xlr wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug. the instrument input works ok with my taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud. i guess it's ok as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals.

Review: .i'm a guitar player and singer who works with a band and as a solo and as a duo with a bass player. i found one of these used for half the retail price. it had no microphone but i already have mics and i don't like wireless anyway and don't need one. besides, who could pass up the bargain as long as the unit works.well, it was great. i brought a small behringer guitar amp in case i had to choose between guitar and vocals in terms of sound quality since the unit has onle one set of tone controls. big surprise; my martin gpa sounded great through the pwma-230 and so did my vocals. i didn't need anything else for a duo gig in a large and semi-loud bar. volume was strong, the sound was clear and full and the guitar and voice sounded as natural as could be. it's light as a feather (i have troubles with my knees and use a cane and it was no problem) and it sounds great. and since i play there once a week i left it at the gig and do not worry about theft or breakage since the unit is so inexpensive and replaceable even at the marketplace price. i might give it 4 1/2 stars but i can't figure out how to get half-stars. this is a godsend to one and two person acts who already have enough to carry. with my zt club amp for my telecaster for band gigs and the pwma-230 for acoustic gigs i have more room, less to carry and less to worry about.update oct. 25th:i think others have mentioned problems with pyle-pro audio's customer service. i must say that my experience with them has been unsatisfactory too. i wrote to them praising their product and asked if for specs on the power cord and whether they sold an extra in case i lost the one that came with the unit and if they also sold a cover for it. i wrote a least three times and got no response so far. the website was no help and calling them directly was worse; got the wrong dept., was transferred to a dept. which never picked up the phone. i still love the pwma230 but i am no fan of its manufacturer.update oct. 28to be fair, someone did finally contact me today. my questions were unanswered and i don't think my e-mail was read very carefully but at least they did respond. i'll update as to the answers and information provided.

Review: i only use this as a tube amp for vocal. for the price, i can drive 2 mics, and fit it in a 1u space. the tube sound is good enough for live performance for as long as i don't crank it up too much, it also helps with the gain of the sm58 as it's much lower than my other line6 mic. i used to have multiple studio projects vtb-1s and art tube pacs but their tubes seem to have died due to old age, and i mainly cared for the tube feature in them, so stepping down to the mic2200 is fine with me.if you want to get warmer vocal sound, and don't want to invest too much for it, the mic2200 is the way to go, imo. however, buying behringer products always require crossing fingers (and hope that they last). so i'll update should i encounter problems.

Review: i operate an alternative broadcast studio, we create music related content and broadcast it on the internet. we needed some stand-alone microphone preamps and after searching the internet i decided to give this behringer unit a try.this single rack space unit provides two independent microphone preamps, each of which is equipped with a single band of sweepable parametric equalization to adjust the timbre of the final output. before i even tried the piece as a preamp i opened it up to look inside.do not EXPECT to change the tubethe tube is mounted in such a way that it is probably impossible to change it out for a different one.fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube. there is no schematic provided so it's really impossible to say how the tube is implemented in the circuit and how much it actually contributes to the tone of the unit.how does it soundthe preamps sound very good, full, rich, crisp highs, deep lows, it's a function of the microphone you connect to it as far as i can tell. for comparison i a-b compared this preamp to our very expensive api 3124+ preamp which is a 4-channel unit that we paid over $500 per preamp-channel for, that is 10-times the price per channel of this behringer unit. i'm not going to say the behringer beat the api but they were a dead heat in most listening tests. my female partner who is not too technical (but has great ears) thought the behringer was just as good as the api. we also have a grace m801 which is another over-$500/channel preamp, she definitely liked the behringer sound better than the grace (personally i think it was the eq on the behringer that affected her choice when comparing to the grace).if my api or grace preamps go toast i will definitely have them repaired. if the behringer dies, it's going in the trash and i'll buy another one. it's simple economics and at $100 for two preamps that sound as good as they do these are really nice. they sound good. they have an industry standard packaging. the input and output connectors are excellent. it even has a line input mode so you can add a little tube distortion to a line-level signal (i have not tried this because we don't need it).we broadcast between three and ten, live one-hour shows per week using this preamp for vocals. nobody in our listening audience has ever complained and none of them know we switched from our high-end pieces to this very inexpensive preamp. now our expensive preamps are back over in our production studio and are used for recording tracks that play behind our live performances during the shows.reliabilitywe have not had any problems with this unit. it is warmed up for an hour before each broadcast, i've never heard any noise or bad stuff come from it. we have a lot of behringer gear in our studio, it lives right along side gear from neve, api, allen and heath, ua, meyer, lexicon and apogee. out of 103 pieces of behringer equipment i've bought we've had two pieces that had problems and those occurred right out to the box. i had much worse reliability with crown amplifiers than behringer products and i really like crown amps, regardless of the problems, they just sound so good. in my experience the behringer products have provided professional results for an amazing low price. that's a win-win in my book.

Review: i'm just getting into miking and recording music, mainly to get my son off to a good start. i'm kind of feeling my way. when i wasn't getting a good result from a dynamic mic, a friend suggested a pre-amp and/or a condenser mike. i ended up getting both (the amp tube pre-amp) and running this through the amp into my tascam dp-008. wow! i have to work on getting the levels matched properly, but this thing is just so much cleaner than the dynamic mics when used on an acoustic guitar. our music sessions have slowed down a bit (he just turned 16, so hanging with the old man is the last thing on his mind, lol), but this is a quality piece of equipment that seems durable. includes a nice hard plastic carry-case, too. for this kind of money, you can't really go wrong.

Review: [later: the mic is indeed the behringer c-1, but amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the c-1u. unlike amazon's description, this is not a mic that comes with usb plug, phantom power, and computer connectivity. and, of course, none of the advertised \"included\" computer software programs is included. it's a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp / p.a. with an xlr jack and phantom power. it will not connect to the usb port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power. moreover, amazon's form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement--presumably for another mic just like this one! if you want the described mic, amazon is showing it from a different vendor--at about 30 more plus s&h.;]the behringer c-1 mic is the best condenser mic i've used for the money, its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly, high-end mics at the radio station (npr) where i occasionally work. however, behringer makes a distinction between the c-1 and the c-1u. the description on amazon fits the c-1u, not the c-1. so one way or another, 50% of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed.indeed, the c-1u is a phantom-powered mic that doesn't require phantom power, which it derives from the usb port of a computer. moreover, the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre-amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly (and time-consuming) xlr to usb adapter. it's ready to go--just plug it into your laptop and start recording. (i use sound studio, but the included free software--audacity--works practically as well.)on the other hand, if the mic is a c-1 as advertised, be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic, with an xlr connector and a phantom power requirement (found on numerous recording devices and p.a. amps or available on a neat little pre-amp sold by amazon, the a.r.t.).having just returned a keyboard--the m-audio pro88sx--for which amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description (for the m-audio pro88, not the pro88sx), i'd be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive--the c-1 as advertised, or the c-1u as described. at least if you're purchasing directly from amazon instead of a sub-vendor, you can be assured of a hassle-free return. and if the mistake is due to amazon's description, returns are generally postage-free.

Review: this microphone deserves the positive reviews it has received. it is very well made equipment, which is readily apparent to a total sound equipment novice like myself. the item as pictured looks different from what i received; it is not the all lighter gray plastic looking body base, it's more of champagne color and is metal and the screw on adapter on the bottom is black (heavy duty plastic). not sure why the picture is showing that is, because the actual microphone i received is much more impressive looking.i was initially looking to spend ~$125 on a simple home recording setup using my imac. i ultimately spent about $135 because i moved to a behringer mixer board that can convey the appropriate power to a condenser mic like this one.for those who are starting out with recording, i recommend this microphone and a quality xlr cord and you will not be disappointed with your results.

Review: works well. it can detect tones from the electric input or acoustically. i find myself using it a lot. even as i learn the notes on the guitar fret-board. if i guess incorrectly it reminds me of the note. i also use it to intonate my guitar. it has some other advanced features, but i haven't need them. display is nice and large even though i still need my reading glasses to see the note.

Review: i have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, i have had enough.the main problem with this tuner is the usability.the tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.the needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever i pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.the poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.enough said, i bought a new tuner, the seiko sat800, for a bit more money that this.the main differences between sat800 and the ca-40:sat800 has a build-in light, ca-40 does not.ca-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, sat800 does not.sat800 has a auto and manual mode, ca-40 has auto.sat800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1e, 2e, etc, ca-40 displays only displays the alphabet, e for all oactaves.sat800 has a numerical display for the cents off, ca-40 does not.the needle graph on the seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.i wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner. i was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on amazon and i hope you would not be.

Review: what happened to all the korg tuners that had led lights on it? don't get me wrong this tuner works great and makes tuning to e flat much easier than on a non chromatic tuner but that's all i use it for. i prefer my older tuners that light up, this screen is really dim and there's not a back light. my guitar room isn't super bright and it's very difficult to read.guess that's why the price is so cheap.

Review: this tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. as soon as i insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low b flat and stays there... even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end. at first i thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, i also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. so again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input.

Review: there are better tuners out there. far better. this could be good, but it seems to me that all korg products seem to think of standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to standard (especially when tuning the g string)! i personally play exclusively in standard for my electric playing, but sometimes i want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. this piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using \"f\" or \"c\" notes. i have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (i say that with love) that play in open tunings. trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere.

Review: after experiencing some frustration with the tone differences and the difference in the amount of noise between a stevens steel bar (for lap playing) and a dunlop 210 glass over-the-finger slide (for \"spanish style\" playing), i decided to try the dunlop harris tapered brass slide. it's probably a personal issue, but i much prefer the weight of the brass slide. the taper seems to cover the stings of my resonator guitar more consistently than the straight glass slide. the sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control. this slide also seems to be well made and has a nice shine to it. the material and the fact that it fits better than the glass slide are significant pluses. another practical plus for the brass slide is that i don't have to worry about what would happen if i drop it. in short: it's a winner.

Review: i purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though i make every effort to avoid them, and to protect the side where i rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time.i've used carnuba car wax many years ago, and this is a much higher grade, easier to apply, easy to remove.there were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that i did not notice at first and i was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface. they were very minor and did not affect the wood, but this will seal them. not a sufficient defect to return the instrument.another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal. i have open tuning machines, and before applying tri-flow with a pinpoint applicator, i used this wax, let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel. the chrome is gleaming. they're really beautiful. did a great job on the headstock as well with mop and abalone inlay when the strings were removed. also got the tuning pegs. this is a 000 - om acoustic. only way i can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge, (i used distilled water) so if someone left too much water - possibly a problem, but all worked fine for me.

Review: i bought this wax and compared it to meguiars i've been using for years and it surpasses meguiars by miles. i have a few guitars and they really shine with this wax, you can really see the depth of the paint with this wax and it works great on headstocks also. i like the applicator and the fact that this is a paste wax which is effortless to apply.along with a few high end guitars, i also have a few beaters. i used this wax on an old squier that is thoroughly used and it looks fantastic. fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great.i use old t shirts to buff the wax off the guitars and found that it comes off chrome easilly, i overdid it with an older les paul guitar and was surprised to see the wax come off with ease. i will buy this stuff again and again, my local guitar shop sells this for the same price.

Review: i really feel like this thing is my personal slave, just standing off to the side, waiting to grab my guitar when i hand it off. it is reliable and rock solid. the tripod base has been very steady so far. it really is a great product.the other thing i have to say about this stand is that it has the non-scuff padding on the all the right places. i bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material. and it did, but not at all the guitar contact points.i do have to laugh at the folks here and on musician's friend who have given this a bad rating because of the following:1. \"it ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward.\" - the basic idea is their guitar was on-stage, someone pushed the stand forward, the patented guitar retaining mechanism disengaged when the base of the guitar touch the floor on the way to the ground, releasing the guitar and dumping on the floor. reality: let's say the stand held onto the guitar. it still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar. sometimes accidents happen. don't blame the stand. blame the moron who knocked over your guitar.2. \"the guitar touches the floor.\" - it's not supposed to! try elevating the next, or make sure you bought the model appropriate for your kind of guitar.this stand is worth the extra money over those $15 disasters. spend an extra $10 and save yourself the headache.

Review: i've been eyeing these stands for a while - ~$40-50 always seemed like such a lot of money for something to just hold a guitar upright. i'd spent a little money (usually $5-10) here and there on cheapy little stands with the spinning base. now that i finally have one of these, i'm throwing those pieces of junk out and buying a few more of these hercules stands.it hold acoustic and electric guitars very well. with the extendable neck, it can also handle a bass guitar. the angle this leans back makes it very stable, and when a guitar is hanging on it, the center of gravity is such that it takes quite a bit of force to tip the stand over. it holds both electric and acoustics. i haven't done any full drop tests, but regardless of which guitar i put on it, the stand didn't once feel like it was going to tip over easily or drop the guitar.piece of mind is key with an instrument that costs several thousand dollars, and this stand lives up to expectations, and does exactly what it's meant to do.

Review: my only complaint is that it doesn't fold up smaller, but otherwise this is an excellent stand. i have to concede i'm a bit spoiled by the super light weight and much more compact folded dimensions of myk & m memphis pro guitar stand. however that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build. the extra heft of the hercules has the advantage of slightly better stability when you remove the instrument from the stand (the k&m; tends to want to bounce backward as the weight is removed if used on a padded carpeted floor). despite not folding up quite as small, the hercules is simpler to unfold and adjust (one action for legs, one action for height, whereas the k&m; has three separate legs and two vertical sections / clamps). i do realize that i bought the one without the folding yoke and am not considering that aspect when comparing it to the k&m.; length and girth folded would still be quite a bit larger than the k&m; (large enough that i won't try carrying it in my gig bag pocket as i do the k&m;).i'm also not convinced hercules' trade mark pivoting finger yoke is all that necessary on this type of stand. the back angle and the fact that a good portion of the instrument rests against the padded legs means it would take so much force to knock an instrument off of it that it's knock the whole stand over. no big deal, just more parts (and weight). i think i prefer k&m;'s yoke, as it automatically adjusts inward to the width of the neck as weight is applied. the hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting review s of the gs100 are also more favorable, and the gs100 is cheaper (which suits my cheapness.

Review: i've been playing the guitar since the 1960's, so i've gone through plenty of guitar stands. always found the hanging-type to be the safest & most secure. for a long time i was using the hamilton chrome hanging stand. when i first saw these being used by all the guitar players at the church i attend (christ community church, st charles, il), i decided to give them a look. the build quality is very good and all the sections that come in contact with the guitar (electric or acoustic) are padded with a foam material to prevent scratching/ denting. it offers a very solid support and i feel safe putting my guitar on it. this is the only type of stand i prefer to use. i do wish it wasn't made in china, too much of our money goes to that country (just my opinion). the bottom line is that i am very happy with this stand and would recommend it to any guitar player who wants a sturdy, well built stand that keeps the guitar safe and should last for ever.

Review: i heard alot about these stands and finally decided to buy one after my cheapo one fell over with my bass still on it.this is a nice looking, well designed stand and feels like it can withstand the rigors of constant use. however, the 5th time i took this to a show, i expanded it and one of the screws and nuts attaching the back leg to the support bar fell off and i never did fine the missing screw...wound up wrapping electrical tape around it to support my bass for the night. i ended up buying some screws and fixing it (which was also a pain as the nut needs to be inserted about 6 inches down the pipe and secured so you can thread the screw into it....not an easy task. i really expected better quality for $35 0 after such light use....still love it, but not to a 5 star level.

Review: i bought this stand primarily to hold my epiphone les paul. i have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the hercules. the stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs. there is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands. i can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues. i plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar. i like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place.i strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there, the extra cost is well worth the investment. i bought this at my local guitar shop for $40 after looking into it, the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while i was there.update 11/5/12- a few weeks ago, i bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers. i usually buy locally, but the deal here was great. the stand is worth the price and more.

Review: i had been leery about leaving my fender 5 string custom jazz bass on guitar stands until i met the hercules gs414b. the stand is \"built like a tank\" with sturdy legs and a strong upper support that fits the neck and headstock of my bass perfectly. my bass weighs about 9.5 pounds with the strap and with its long neck, fits perfectly in the hercules, with the body of the bass resting well-balanced against the padded legs.the design and reclining angle of the stand makes it extremely stable and i experimented with trying to tip the bass over. it will take more than an \"accident\" to tip the bass off its stand. the self-closing mechanism works very well and requires no effort to lock or to unlock.the lock is engaged by simply placing the bass in the locking mechanism. the lock releases by lifting the bass from the stand.my only dislike is the bright yellow paint on the leg hinge mechanism. i would have preferred the stand being a more conservative all black.

Review: i bought a cheap rogue a100 mandolin, and after setting it up i of course replaced the cheap factory strings. i put these on, and what a difference. these aren't too heavy, not too light. they ring nicely. i find that coating bronze strings with a good string cleaner, like dunlop 65 ultraglide, can help you avoid the dirty fingers and get much more life from the strings.

Review: the j74's are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments. they are bright and brassy when new, and give a decent punch to the sound. however because they are bronze, they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly, especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier. also, since they are round-wound, they are harder to fret than a flat-wound string and harder to shift up and down. but the people who like them change them often, like once in 30 days or so, or whenever they play a gig, to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new. this is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume, being less elastic, and less lively. one thing is sure, that the j74's are loud and zingy, and that's why dealers put them on their mandolins. some folks move to the heavier j75's to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops. the j74's are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when you're in ensemble work. just make sure to change them often to get the best performance.

Review: i am learning to play the guitar. i needed a place to place my lesson book that was a little more ergonomically sound. i debated between this one and the other popular/slightly more expensive one. i cannot speak to that one's assembly process, but i found this one to be reasonably simple.i also like how you can just pull or push the stand in order to raise/lower it. the same goes for tilting. it is a superb stand with ample table space for book, ipad, capo, some picks and if you are creative, headphones. i love it and i am using it almost every single day. very solid construction and the stand with the most height i could find.go ahead and compare specs of each of the stands offered. as of today, this is the one that wins in the height, shelf and space categories.

Review: i think someone else wrote that this is like the music stand they used in high school band class. yup, it is. i would buy again. my use is to hold my books while i try to teach myself how to play guitar. this stand could easily hold a phone book as the lip is about 2+&#34; high. very happy with it.just a warning to those that are picky. because of the way the tube locks together, the part that holds the music can shimmy a little if you knock or brush it. not an issue for me, but also did not want someone to think this is like a brick and won't move.It would be hard to tip over because the quality and thickness make this puppy heavy. buy it, you'll like it. it will survive a nuclear blast.

Review: i lost my trusty slide and really miss it. the dunlop 220 feels heavier and looser on my little finger than my old timer but, it does sound sweet. if it was just a bit smaller diameter, that would do the trick. my old timer had enough corrosion inside to keep it secure so, a brand-new, sleek fit isn't a plus in my case. the dunlop is well made, as expected. it's just not the antiques roadshow model i had in mind. hmmm, might be a new product idea - rough up the inner surface and come up with a catchy name.

Review: i've been using dunlap's tortex picks now for going on 10 years, and recently just switched over to heavy jazz picks (smaller - sharper tip). these picks work great. they provide enough surface area that they won't slip easily from between your fingers. they allow for a high level of sensory feedback from your fingertips once you get used to them. any jazz or soloist guitar player would likely find these extremely comfortable to use. i also prefer the high thickness so there's no flex in the pick while playing which makes it easy to judge the pressure you're putting on the strings.

Review: nice picks, much brighter sounding than the jazz 3 nylon picks. i prefer the jazz 3s since thr jazz 3s are warmer sounding and wear resistant. but these pitch blacks are not bad. they do wear down quickly but a dozen should last a good amount of time. this pick does what jazz picks are suppose to do and in my university's jazz ensemble the three tips are useful and makes playing difficult jazz chord easy. it will feel awkward at first if you never used jazz picks but once you get the hang of it you'll never go back to standard picks.

Review: i've been a jazz iii fan since 1997 starting with the red (too buttery and rounded sounding) and then moving to the black (durable but a bit tubby sounding). eventually i tried a 1 mm tortex of this pick which had good attack but was somewhat mushy sounding through amp sims.but then i tried this .60mm and holy cow the sound change was like getting new pick ups. more mids, more attack, faster attack, scratchier attack, and less lows. now you'd think this would make your guitar sound thin, and indeed it sounds thinner but also clearer by a factor of two.thus when recording through amp sims, you get a clearer more dynamic more attack-ish sound. when using the 1 mm the fundamental was a bit too strong which made for a mushy amp sim sound, but this .60mm did the trick. it just sounds heavier, tighter, and more articulate. while it does wear faster, for recording purposes it's my current ultimate pick of choice.so if your guitar doesn't sound clear, articulate, or aggressive enough first give this pack of picks a shot. but you don't have to take my word for it... da-nehh-nan!

Review: here's what strap locks are supposed to do: securely attach your strap to your guitar. these do that much better than schallers and the fender rip-offs of schaller.i used the schallers many years ago. they look great, but the problem is they screw onto the strap with a nut. i am very good with maintenance, check for loose parts, etc., but at one gig with my super heavy american deluxe 5 string jazz bass, the nut worked its way off the strap, and i dropped it. it was with a heavy leather strap, and i did tighten it down with pliers upon installation and i'm sure i kept it maintained. absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable. never again. unless you want to inspect and retighten your strap locks at every single rehearsal and gig, forget about schallers. they're a good company and they make great tuners, i don't fault the materials, it's simply that threaded things can work their way loose, a fatal design flaw for this type of device. come on, its only purpose is to not allow something to come off of something else.the dunlop strap locks fit on with a locking ring. it is impossible to remove these from the strap by accident. if you're having trouble getting the lockrings on, i have a youtube video posted to my channel, nickweissmusic, just search for dunlop strap lock installation. it's kind of tough at first but with experience, it's very easy. the package instructions are correct but not very helpful.I have these on more than 10 instruments, and have never had even close to a failure in well over a decade. the package recommends periodically lubricating the mechanism inside the lock, but i have never done so, in my experience lubricants usually gunk things up more than they help for things like this. i've never had so much as a grind or squeak from the button or ball bearings in these strap locks, if i did, i'd probably just replace it. i do give the locks a little tug when i put them on to make sure they're engaged, other than that, you can forget about them, which is the way it should be.the only possible downside is that these strap locks keep the strap a little further from the instrument then using no strap locks or the schallers do, to which i say, who cares. well, i guess a lot of people care about that, since i see it in a lot of reviews. if using no strap lock or a poorly designed one is worth it to you, just so you can have your strap a quarter inch closer to your guitar, so be it. i have seen ernie ball strap locks that seem to be a little lower profile, i think they use lock rings too. maybe try those, but i'm sticking with the flawless track record of the dunlops.

(btw, i'm an average grown man, 5'7\ 165) more to come...here we go, a few months later: i just had a chat with a music store guy and found out that a \"large\" thumb pick refers to the thickness of the pick! bottom line, if you want a thumb pick that fits, go to a store and try before you buy! good luck to all.

Review: i've been using national medium thumb picks for the last year until my last one broke. decided to try the dunlop. overall - i'm very pleased with this pick.previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the national mediums. this is true, but isn't a complete description. basically, the national picks are much more elongated - so while the nail to thumb-pad distance is about the same on both, the across nail distance is much greater on the national picks. i actually find the dunlop pick to fit much better, and i don't get extra overhang as with the national (which tends to catch the string).

Review: i have a gibson les paul that i bought used. when it arrived the fretboard was in good shape, but very dry. i first tried lemon oil and it would work, but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it (its rosewood). so i started looking for another solution and found the gerlitz guitar honey.i ordered it and applied it. a few hours later i restrung my guitar and started playing and didn't care for the way the fretboard felt. i think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it wasn't completely dry. i decided to give it another 24 hours.the next day the guitar neck looked and played great. it is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ. bends and slides are smoother than ever.great product and one that i will continue to use. if you need a quick treatment before a gig or something, i would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly. but i would use this in every other regular maintenance situation.

Review: i bought a guitar that had been sitting in a guys closet for the longest time, and the fret board was so dry and colorless. i used this, and the color became rich and less dry. if your fret board is pretty dry, do not remove the oil. let it sit overnight and then remove it with a towel. leave it longer depending on how dry the fret board is. i love this because it doesn't leave an oily residue and it doesn't have a smell that stands out. i didn't even notice a smell. i definitely would say this is a must-have.

Review: i requested this for christmas in 2011 and was pleased to get it. i've used it on at least 7 guitars and it works great. first i used it to treat clean fingerboards that were in good shape and it worked well. it can even make a big improvement to the dry, porous surface of a cheap fretboard, and good rosewood fingerboards love the stuff.later on i got some used guitars and used cleaned the gunky fingerboards with guitar honey (apply it, scrub with toothbrush, wipe with paper towel, repeat) and it did a lot better than i expected at removing the yucky buildup next to the frets.i like to apply it fairly heavily and lay the guitar down with the fingerboard level and facing up, and give it time to soak in. you will notice that some areas soak it more than others. i move it around on the fretboard so it soaks in evenly. then wipe off the excess with a paper towel and you're ready to go.when i wipe down the strings after playing the first time or two after treating with guitar honey, the rag shows dark lines where the guitar honey cleaned the strings. i like making my strings last longer!get some. i don't think you'll regret it.

Review: i have a lot of high end instruments, and i live in new england so proper fretboard care is a must - especially with ebony and other woods that are prone to cracking and drying.this stuff is fantastic - much better than lemon oil, dries a lot cleaner and doesn't leave any oily residue on the board at all. an hour after it's applied it sets up and doesn't get on your hands. i apply it on occasion with the strings on (i use elixirs) and have never once had a problem.the best few bucks you'll spend on guitar care. 5 stars.

Review: this is a pretty good deal if you look at the price of other capos, and you get free shipping.yeah, it's not as quick to use as the spring loaded ones, but still not bad; better than an elastic strap type.it is also great for creating your own short cut and drop d capos. with a sharp razor you could do all sorts of crazy stuff.do not overtighten the screw because the bottom arm is thin. you can add a pad of some sort, or just take care to not to over-tighten it.i'm the type of person that would glue in a small piece of material if it broke through. so, far it doesn't look like it will though.

Review: it'll do for setup work, and the price is right. i wouldn't recommend it for live use or for anyone who changes keys every song, its too fiddly to adjust and get firmly set. i also wouldn't recommend it for anyone just starting out. a spring clamp type capo would serve better. this one is probably best for somebody who rarely needs to use it, and just wants one one hand or to keep in the case as a back up.

Review: works great, but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time.some responses to comments i've seen in the reviews:--i've had mine for 5 years, used moderately, and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible. haven't put a pad there or anything.--the manual screw functionality does, i feel, give an added level of control...you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz.--However, range of motion is on the wide side. to get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic, i have to put it right on the edge of the 1st string, and screw it down all the way, and it does sometimes leave some buzz.the price is nice though, so i would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo.

Review: i was looking for a cleaner and a polisher to get the grease and grime off my guitars. i decided to trythe dunlop formula 65 polish & cleaner. i thought, why not try a 2 in 1 formulation? after all, thereare shampoo and conditioners in one bottle, and that works well for me. so why not this? possiblyfaulty logic but i went with it at the time.well i have to say that it did well. i used a soft cotton cloth, placed some formula 65 on the cloth(not the guitar) and slowly worked on the more oily looking areas of my gibson es-339. this guitarmodel has a high gloss black lacquer finish. the dunlop polisher & cleaner did a very good job on thefinish and did not leave any streaks behind. it was after using the substance all over the guitar that i realized that one must not get formula 65in any cracks or chips. i am thankful that i did not have any of said cracks or chips. i am usually oneto read directions thoroughly; but not this time. no harm done but i will make it a point to inspect myguitars for cracking or chipping prior to using formula 65 again. this stuff works well. it was able to lift off, with some effort, greasy build-up over the last year. i amnot a messy person but oily hands can and often leave smudges that mar the surface of the finish. notonly does it clean up the oils from my hands and gosh knows what else, it also left a nice shine as well.the finish looks very good. this 4oz bottle will go a long way. it doesn't take much to work.i tried using an untreated micro-fiber polish cloth and that only pushed the oily mess around. that iswhen i decided to get the dunlop polisher & cleaner. it definitely worked a lot easier than the un-treated micro-fiber cloth. i am now using the micro-fiber cloth to rub off any new smudges as theyoccur. i plan to re-apply the cleaner/polisher when i oil my fret board a couple times a year.i gave the formula 65 cleaner & polisher 4-1/2 stars due to the fact you can potentially do damage toyour guitar. chips and cracks do occur throughout the course of a guitar's life and can be expectedalbeit not wanted. so 4-1/2 stars because it does what it says it will do but you've got to be carefulusing it. so...be careful out there people....note: there is a \"california propositon 65 warning\" on the web page under 'product details'. amazonhas placed it there as a public service. it reads: \"warning: this product contains chemicals knownto the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.\" just thoughtyou ought to know.

Review: this is the best guitar cleaner and polish i have ever used. it cleans the grime and greasy fingerprints off very easilly and leaves a brilliant shine without a waxy/greasy feeling that cream polishes leave. this is a must for black guitars. great product. only wish was that is was bigger than 4oz. it's quite expensive for 4oz. but 2 or 3 sprays does the whole guitar including the neck.

Review: this is just an excellent product. i have been using this product on my guitars for over a year now and as long as they keep making it, i will keep using it. you only need a very little bit to polish the entire guitar and you don't need to use it for every polish. once you put it on initially, you can simply buff your guitar with a dry cloth for the next two or three cleanings and the shine comes right back. there is enough in one bottle to last a very long time.i highly recommend this product and would like to also refer you to the dunlop 65 lemon oil for cleaning your fretboards. the lemon oil very quickly removes any residue and shines the fretboard up extremely well. when it dries, your fretboard is beautiful and very smooth for all your bending and sliding tricks. 50 stars.

Review: i had purchased a different strap for my f-style mandolin and it was adequate but when i learned of this neotech strap and how adjustable it was i ordered it and tossed my earlier strap. this should be configurable for any mandolin body size and shape and for most human body sizes and shapes as well. my only complaint is that the button hole doesn't stay on the end pin of my epiphone mandolin. i solved that issue though by taking a large triangular pick i wasn't happy with, drilling a hole in the middle and cutting a notch from the edge to the hole and then sliding this over the end-pin of the mandolin and the strap hasn't fallen off since (over 2 months of daily playing!)

Review: i wish there was a fine pivot/angle adjustment to orient harp to mouth. i feel i have to angle my head awkwardly to use harmonica no matter how i set it up. i have a big neck and a prominent jaw so the armature does not extend as far as i think i need it to - causing the position of harmonica angle to be awkward for me. for the angle to be right it would be in my mouth ( lol ).this is the least expensive holder i could find nov 2013. since it was inexpensive comparatively i will use a vice and bend it to suit me if my grand nephews don't want it.also not sure why they don't make these wider to accommodate a larger variety of harmonicas as it has a very strong spring action holding harmonica in place, could easily hold a much larger and longer harmonica if designed to do so. a 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design.

Review: this holder, and just about every holder i've ever bought, doesn't hold a harmonica at the right angle for me. they all need one more joint to adjust the angle. i've had hohner racks before so i was prepared. i use harmonica holders for kazoos. this one has a decent spring and may not require the use of duct tape or wire to hold the kazoo in place. i may add the wire or tape just for the kazoo aesthetic. the angle for kazoo use is fine.obviously not everyone's head and neck are the same as mine. this holder may work well for harmonica for some people. if you can, you should try on holders before you buy.

Review: in case you're wondering about the difference between this hohner harmonica holder and the hohners costing more than twice this one's price, this one is made in china while the others are made in germany. now, i'm definitely not one of those who automatically dismiss the quality of chinese made products. i have, in fact, many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there. this item however has some of the good, and some of the more stereotypical problems of chinese goods. pros: cheap. sturdy. and unlike some reviewers, i love the taller height. far far better for you ergonomically not having to stoop and scrunch your neck and windpipe. i also like the tighter springs, though that does take a little getting used to. but the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort. now, the cons: it's true what others have said: the plastic neck tube smells. not as bad as some have said, but an annoying chemical smell is definitely noticeable. i cut that off and got a big wide replacement tube at tap plastics for a buck (make sure the one you get is wide enough to slide over the bends in the neck loop bar thingee - i got the 1/2\" diameter). 2nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is not bent evenly. mine was distinctly taller on one side than the other, and the neck loop was way off. i did my best to bend all parts to even, but the flat metal part is tough to shape. the reason i didn't return it is that i figure most of them are equally uneven: i just picture a bunch of poor souls slaving away bending these suckers by hand, with little or no machine help to ensure consistency. with the work i did on it myself, it works fine and is now fairly even, and like i said, the taller height is just about right for me. it's just annoying that some of the most basic expectations aren't met (like holding your harmonica at an even height on both sides). all this said, the bottom line is that i prefer using this over my german made hohner holder because it's better ergonomically (taller), holds my harp more securely, and the traditional dual butterfly nut design just works far better and with less effort than the \"nouveau\" single butterfly nut design of my more expensive german hohner. knowing what i know of its drawbacks, i'm still tempted to pick up another as a back-up or spare. it's a great deal if you're willing to do a little work on it.

Review: yes, this pedal is plastic, the switch is not the most durable feeling, and the knob placement is annoying. at less than $15, you need to be able to look past these things. i've had a higher failure rate with the dunlop cry baby and that thing is built like a cinder block. this pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended. which is to say, this pedal does a nice job in overdriving the preamp tubes in your valve amplifier. no brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going. no overdrive pedal lives up to it's potential running into a solid state (even modeling) amplifier. it's just not what they are really intended to do and they end up sounding buzzy. some have complained about rf interference with the use of the fab pedals (getting radio signals through your amp). i have had that happen with pedals costing 5x the price of the fab- particularly when running a long pedal chain. based on tone alone, this pedal can overdrive your tube preamp as well as most anything out there under $100. check out the youtube review of this pedal by a guy that goes by 'intheblues'. i believe he uses a drri with a strat, and this pedal sounds great. if you did a blind test between this pedal and an overdrive costing north of $100 you may be surprised- particularly if your other gear (amp and guitar) are halfway decent. what i did note though, was that this pedal has a wee bit more gain and a little less treble than my other ts type pedals. that doesn't make it worse or better- just different. the 'mid-hump' is actually less pronounced than in a tubescreamer, which is a good thing imho. there are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market! it will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers. incidentally, the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes. since it isn't true bypass, you will likely get some tone suck if you run a bunch of these in your chain, but if the rest of your pedals have decent bypass you will be fine. lest you mistake me for a novice fanboy with no point of reference for my review- i've been playing guitar since 1979 and have used 'vintage' dirt boxes since before they were vintage and overpriced. i am years past caring about the brand and all about getting good sounds from simple gear. ymmv-

Review: this thing sounds great with my tube amps, both with my 2 watt danelectro amp from 1962 with it's 8 inch speaker and my 12 watt excelsior from fender. it has a good range of overdrive levels. it is clearly a vintage style effect that is good for classic rock and dirty lo-fi stuff like the black keys, the white stripes, and garage band like stuff. it is good as a light tone shaper and boost to put a distortion effect into feedback heaven and into total over the top sputtering fuzz. i love mine for the price, and its a good mix up compared to my modded sd-1 and my overdriven tube amps. it's different and just worth having to mess around with. just be a bit gentle and the thick plastic case and switch will last. also, the blue led is very bright. thats either an annoyance or great. rock on!

Review: depending on the amp and guitar you have, this pedal is going to either really be great or be a bummer. it sounds terrific with my fender strat (single coil) danelectro (lipstick pickups) on my solid state amps, giving them a warm tube like overdrive.it sounds terrible on my tube amp and my vintage silvertone amp, it really sounds aweful with my 1980's kramer, loaded with humbucker pickups.you'll either love it or hate it! that will decide mostly on the type of guitar and amp you use, it's a different pedal with every combination.

Review: the danelectro fab series of pedals offer a great sound without digging into your budget. the d-2 overdrive effects pedal works great and gives me that soft growl fuzz that works well when playing the blues.... the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is &#34; it tends to be a little noisey &#34; if you turn the gain up too much. you can get a noise filter to add to you pedal board that will take care of this and any other noise problems you may have. this series of pedals ( fab ) have hard plastic cases and less expensive hardware than the more costly units but works quit well. danelectro offers more expensive units but i don't think the sound is much better, just the hardware is better, but my view!!!. you can't go wrong with this product, danelectro has been around for years and makes a great product...i have six danelectro effects pedals and they all work great...

Review: this pedal is remarkable for useful tones. the sound may not be for everyone, but i already have a boogie for the really metal like distortion. i needed something that was different but still usable, and i feel this pedal fills the bill. the low price tag didn't hurt my feelings either. this is a win-win buying decision as far as i am concerned.

Review: the fab overdrive pedal does not work well for me. in fairness to the product, i was aware from reviews that it gives varying results based on guitar and amp. i have a epiphone les paul special ii, with a fender frontman 25r amp. no matter how i adjust it, it has a muddy sound. i've heard it used with higher end guitars and amps with very good results. i took a chance based on the low cost, and i do plan to do some upgrades to my guitar. the guitar is new, and has the strings that came with it. i plan to get a better grade immediately, and that may be all i need to get the expected sound. there are several reviews of this product on you tube. you can do a search there, and hear what it is capable of.

Review: i use this on my mandolin, it is easy to use once you have the trick of it, first this thing has a long end with eyelets on it (that the other reviewers fear will scratch the neck of their instruments), and a short end (designed to prevent said scratches). to use place the capo on your strings with the short end facing you, use your left thumb to hold it in place with the short end dangling just below your thumb, next loop the long end over the back of the neck using your right hand to pull it under the neck and then up toward your thumb, this will trap the short end under the long end and prevent the long ends eyelets from touching your instruments neck, now just rotate your left thumb out of the way so you can buckle the strap in place and you are all set.i prefer this capo over the other 2 i have because it is so tiny, barely bigger than the first two joints of my pinkie, and yet it does the job it was designed for, its small size means i can toss it in my mandos hardcase storage box and forget about it till i need it.the only downside to this is that the elastic will eventually stretch to where it will no longer work, but then again at 5 bucks you can't have everything.

Review: it's very small. it's a fabric stretchy capo, the old type, that's quite difficult to stretch and make stay. it's made with an end that you stretch the fabric over to connect to hold the capo, but the end isn't very long and i don't trust it to stay while playing for long. i'll keep it as a spare, just in case, anyway.

Review: this little stand serves so many purposes for me..at home, it is a keyboard stand and even a stand to put my pedalboard on when i want to test out different pedal configurations.at my gig, it holds my presonus mixer, a laptop and all of my wireless transmitters and receivers.. it is so versatile because it can be narrow or wide and short or tall..as well, i have the onstage connector that will allow you to connect a mic boom to it.. i plan on using this one day to hold my ableton live machine as well as a small 2 octave keyboard and i will use the mic boom arm at that point! even as a keyboard stand, i like it because i can put pedals underneath it.. with it fully extended to &#34;long&#34; mode, i can fit both my pedal train pro and mini underneath it.. of course, that is 54 solid inches of stage front though.. which is indeed a lot for the small places i fit into with my duo..

Review: this is certainly a heavy duty stand! it weighs quite a bit, is made of solid metal, and i would not hesitate to think it could hold quite a bit of weight. however, while it seems stable side-to-side, the spread of the legs does not taper much at all from top to bottom, and i believe it would fall over quickly if bumped from the front or back. this makes me nervous for live performances or close quarter practices.

Review: wow, this works! at first, i was a little wary about using the liquidthe original peg drops by ardsleyon the pegs for apprehension from the warnings that came with the product. being my own bumbling teacher, there was a fear i could damage the finish on my rather inexpensive instrument. however, i needed help tuning a couple of balky pegs, so i closed my eyes and blundered ahead (that's just a figure of speech; for i was careful, using the stuff for the first time). with care, cotton and a small rag (torn off my moth eaten underwear) i went ahead, willing to try anything. i even removed the strings from the pegs (only one at a time - starting with the inner one first), put the drops on the proper peg locations and restrung the string. tuning then became a breeze. to think i used up a great glob of practice time, not fiddling, but tuning. bop! could'a had a veggie drink!

Review: these drops are not just a convenience. in my opinion they are a neccessity for beginning violinists. if you are reading this wondering if you should consider buying this product to stop your tuning pegs from slipping, or to make them turn smoother and in less dramatic tuning jumps, the answer is yes. buy this, it does work, and it works very well.Even though the instructions said to put a drop on two different places on each peg, i wanted to go light just in case, so at first i only put 1 drop on each peg. i didn't know what to expect and you can always put more on, but too much could be a bad thing. also, each instrument is different, each peg is different. i had one very stubborn peg, while the others were just the normal level of obnoxious about slipping. you may only need 1 drop on some pegs and the reccomended 2 drops on the others. i had new strings on, which of course are going to take forever to stretch out and will need constant tuning. i did not remove the strings, i just loosened the pegs a little and pulled them out a tiny bit, one at a time, then put the first drop on the spot where the peg would make contact when put back in (on the tuning head side of the peg, the part you actually turn). i put the 2nd small drop on the dead end of the peg (not the end you turn). be careful when applying that you don't get more than 1 small drop at a time. this stuff spreads out over time, a tiny drop goes a long way. one bottle should last you a very long time.what to expect: with one drop the effect is immediate. you will notice the pegs turn smoother and hold their position much better. after playing for awhile i decided to put a 2nd drop on each peg (as suggested by the included instruction sheet). this helped them all to stay in place even better than before. the pegs now also turn smoother and easier and i can tune much easier than before, in smaller more accurate adjustments, and the strings actually hold the tuning for much longer than before.great product. buy it, use it, and be happy.

Review: my pegs have been giving me difficulty for a while, and have been temperamental and subject to slipping for as long as i can remember. i'd guess they have about 100 years of wear on them.i used to be able to deal with it. violin teachers and techs i knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem. more recently, i tried adding fine tuners on g d and a to make it easier to tune, but the resultant shortening of the strings affected the sound too much. i figured i'd give the drops a try. the change was immediate. i was able to work with the pegs more easily, and slippage went away immediately. i decided to give it 24 hours before changing strings. when i did, i also removed three fine tuners and still had the control i needed.after changing one string, things worked well, but then i had the peg slip suddenly. i figured i'd try retuning and that perhaps it was my fault, but it ended up slipping loose again. i tried reapplying peg drops, and that seemed to fix the problem. after that, i had no more slippage, but i now have one peg that is binding.the instructions are clear but minimal and open ended. i don't expect them to tell exactly how often to use the drops but they could have given a bit more info on what to expect, what symptoms indicate, and so forth. i tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions, but never heard back.suffice to say the drops made an incredible difference, but did not provide me with a foolproof instant cure. i'd definitely recommend them, but i hope to get some comments from users with more experience so i can have a better idea what makes people know it's time to reapply and what they experience when they do it.the advantage of good peg control is that you can get high quality gut or synthetic (not metal core) strings and be able to tune them precisely without tonal problems being introduced by fine tuners. the effort i had without the drops made me avoid playing and i was using a yamaha sv-120 most of the time. that can be fun, but i didn't realize how much i missed the richness of an old acoustic violin that stayed in tune.

Review: for under $200, i'm amazed at how nice this guitar is! first, it was perfectly playable right out of the box - all i had to do was tune it. and it stays in tune nicely too.i did replace the strings shortly after getting it. there was nothing wrong with the original strings - no rust and they sounded fine - i just wanted something softer so i put on dedario silk and steel light strings, which are much easier on my fingers and have a nice mellow sound. i am a novice transitioning from a nylon string guitar so i needed the most gentle strings i could get. now this guitar is a joy to play. problem is, i get nothing done because i can't put it down!!!and the spruce top is pure eye candy as are the mahogany back and sides. and i like the mother of pearl yahama inlay on the headstock. very classy! the quality of build and finish on this instrument is top notch. it just exudes quality and feels solid and balanced in your hands.you can spend a lot more on a guitar, but why would you want to when you can get something like this???

Review: this one is probably closer to a $150 guitar. the fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it's just like most of the other made in china guitar. from the reviews i was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200, but i'm not at all impressed. one thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they're a jack of all trades but a master of none.i recently bought a johnson jg-610-n, a johnson jg-620-n, a bristol bd-16, a jasmine s35, and this yamaha. if i'd only played the yamaha i'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side i can definitely say it's not at all amazing. the bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better. the johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish. the jasmine is nice but i haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.the yamaha fg700gs is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low end punch. now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great. the bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison. also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit \"hive mind\" where everybody buys into a hype. maybe i got a dud guitar, but i doubt it, they're all made in the same factory.

Review: i bought this to connect a technics tt with an audio technica cartridge to my newer onkyo receiver with no phono input. the unit did work but i had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume. in addition i have an onkyo m3040 connected to the receiver that i use for as a zone 2 amplifier. with this preamp i am getting some serious spikes into the amp. they are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop. i do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.this unit may work perfectly fine with a behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all. i am returning it.

Review: this is a well assembled and packaged unit, designed to a price. so certain compromises have been necessary.compromises such as a single-supply wall wart - partly an advantage to get the ac out of the amplifier itself - and very basic circuit, with inexpensive parts. the preamp supports only moving magnet cartridges, and has no provision for load adjustments or the like.on the other hand it works well, is packaged nicely, and serves its purpose for folks who are not audiophiles or fussy, but want a basic phono/riaa amp for their turntable to connect to line inputs. also, by avoiding the &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; tendency of units that include inexpensive d/a converters and such for usb output, this is almost certainly cleaner for the analog-only uses for which it is suited.the unit is also very &ldquo;hackable&rdquo; if you'd like to upgrade things like capacitors, resistors, or the opamps. or use a nicer external power supply - the first thing i'd upgrade. lastly, if you know the ideal capacitive load for your cartridge, and the capacitance of your phono cables, you can adjust the loading on the inputs accordingly.recommended if your budget is limited.

Review: behringer has done it again. the pp400 ultra-compact phono preamp is exactly what it looks like:it's ultra-compact. it takes up a very negligible amount of space. it will sit comfortably between a turntable and another component.in its compactness, though, it does not sacrifice usability. it has no trouble amplifying a turntable's signal to line level. before buying a preamp, amp could only boost my turntable to a 'easy listening' level. the noise was evident in the signal due to far too much amplification being necessary. with the help of this preamp, my amp no longer acts as a crutch and i can comfortably listen to music without my amp's 'i'm turned up to 11 and struggling' noise.the build quality is far superior than anything else at this price point. it's not cheap plastic like many companies would try to sell, the entire enclosure is fairly thick metal. this makes for a nice interference shield and overall pleasing look. it also features a ground terminal which will hook up to many turntables and amps to further reduce interference.unfortunately, there is no option to buy it in black. judging from the accessible screws on the side, though, it would be a small task to take apart the enclosure and paint it myself if i wanted.this preamp also does not have a power switch, but this is not much of an issue. it's one small complaint on an otherwise amazing product.summary:if you need a preamp, buy this one. it has the same build quality and performance as much more expensive preamps.

Review: . i did get this from amazontc 754 black phono preamplifier switchablei really needed more aux inputs for cd etc. but right away i noticed my first impression that it sounds overly bright. the next issue is a real problem but it might not be with others. i am using a vintage garrard turntable. the rca jacks work fine with all other amps etc except this little preamp. they are tight but do not make good contact and i need to mess with them. this problem is gone with the new preamp. overall it is a good little unit and you may not have the same issues. if you can afford more or need more inputs you might want to look else where. it does sound ok other than being a little bright. it does do what is supposed to do.

Review: i bought this to replace a behringer uca202. the behringer performs very well for my use (guitar in a home studio), but recently it's become way too sensitive to interference; i was getting noise from the nearby cable modem / router / network drives. this noise was making its way to my recordings too :-(for what ended up being less than twice the price of the behringer i decided to try this unit. not only is it interference-free, it has a much warmer, intimate sound.it's usb powered, installs automatically in about a minute under win7 with no issues. i did go to the lexicon website and get their driver, though, just to be on the safe side.reaper had new entries for the device in the audio settings panel (asio! :-) ). everything just works great, first time. i was even able to remove my little mixer from my entire setup thanks to the zero-latency monitoring on the device :-)great unit. i love the behringer, but this thing kicks it in the tail.

Review: the hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate. make sure you have a good microphone to use with it. the cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for. that seems to be a common problem with music recording programs i've seen - heavy reliance on technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to the typical amateur singer/guitarist. this should come with a good &#34;how-to-use&#34; course that helps the user learn the jargon and common applications.

Review: i am using it to record my garage band's demo to get us more gigs. i have been a gigging musician for over 20 years. had it a few days and with in a half hour after opening it, i had two guitar tracks, a bass track, and drums tracks (from garageband) all laid down. easy to plug in, i am using it with a macbookpro and garageband. very quality recordings so far. like it so far.edit- put down some vocals with a cheap shure mic (pg-48) used fx from garageband and got a nice vocal track, easy to layer over harmonies. still have yet to mic up a drum kit...still enjoying the product, still amazed at the ease of use. did try to install software on a pc with vista, no luck.Edit - mic'd up a drum kit into a mixer, lined it out to this interface, i then mixed the drum mics with the mixer. you can record the drums as a single track so once they're recorded you can not mix them individually (ie. snare, kick and so on). i do get very quality recordings with it set up this way. i am sure a recording engineer could give me better ideas on how to get more out of it, but as for now, i am very pleased.

Review: i bought this pedal to give my single coils some heat. it does that (my dial is set at 10 o'clock). however, i could see a tone purist really bothered by the the mid range coloration from this pedal. in live/practice situations, at high volumes, it doesn't bother me much. in the studio, i won't use this pedal for that reason. it was the right price for me, right now. if you want transparent boost, you gotta pay more.one more thing... a boost pedal really shines when it's running to a tube amp for that extra something. i don't think pushing the input of a digital amp is a good idea for sound's sake. just a thought.

Review: this is a simple preamp booster that adds a bit of dirt so if your looking for a clean boost this isn't it try something else. i find this best used to push the front end of a tube amp. its really similar to an overdrive except this boosts more than a normal one and is good for cutting through the mix on a solo or fattening up single coil pickups. overall great pedal and amazing price highly recommended.

Review: ok...i bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was overkill. i mean i had enough boost and gain from different pedals already so no use for it at the moment. i gave it to a friend of mine that had a simple pedal configuration (distortion and a flanger) and it made a huge difference when he needed to make a solo or bring some \"accent\" to a determinate part of a song.it's a cool pedal but i will recommend it for simple pedal configurations. it will bring the extra juice you need.cheers

Review: i originally bought this pedal to boost an old amplifier signal and it works suprisingly well. i wanted a boost which didn't color tone and this has worked well for my needs. the price is good, i bought it locally for the same price here.since i have bought this pedal, i have upgraded the speaker in the old amp and still use this to boost the speaker to use with pedals. the tone is transparent and boosting pedal output is great. i use it with distortion and overdrive with good results.i have found new uses for my pedals which suffer from volume drop by putting this in front of them. all in all, besides for a good eq pedal, this boost is effective and worth every penny.

Review: this is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home. it's a great little unit. the only set back is that you can not use condenser mics with this, without an external phantom power supply, as there is no phantom power on this unit. you need to get the 802 model if you need phantom power, otherwise this will work fine with regular xlr or hi-z microphones.

Review: (this review is legit)i bought this mixer back in august or september, cant really remember, but i had a horrible experience with this unit, but that's my fault, i bought this mixer without looking at reviews or anything, so i didnt know how to use it.i hooked this up to my desktop through the pink microphone input, and got a horrible, terrible mix, the hiss from the fan ruined it (i nearly had a panic attack), so i took like 9 months to do research, and found out that behringer made the uca202/uca222 for this unit and the 802 mixer, to remove the hiss and unwanted noise.so buy this with the uca202/uca222 to clear up your recordings, do not buy a \"rca to 3.5mm cable\" if your using this for a studio setting like me, and if your beginning like me, do not let these wealthy people fool you, you dont need thousand dollar equiptment, the podcaststudio usb (from behringer) would be fine.so all in all, with my cheap microphone from radio shack and this mixer, the quality was good, but the hiss ruined it!!!!! use a usb audio interface with this from behringer, do it, if you want 5 star audio quality! their website has asio drivers to assist you, ohhh and go on youtube and search up \"uca202 studio\ you'll get videos to help.please, please, please, please do research before you buy anything! good day everyone! ;d

Review: needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer. it is limited in what it can do but it does the job. i'm rapidly becoming a behringer fan. the three points mentioned in another rating (inputs should be out the back, needs rubber feet, and the led) are spot on. i'd also like to see another set of outputs on it as well. it could also use being a tad bigger, they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together. the led for the power on this thing is so bright it's obnoxious, it almost blinds you. other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise...

Review: i bought this mixer in order to combine my bass guitar with an mp3 player for silent practice at home. bass into one channel, ipod into another, headphones out.it works! there are other solutions to this dilemma. pocket-sized headphone amps, and so on. but they're a) more expensive and b) kind of junky and c) come equipped with built-in effects and amp models which i do not want. ymmv.)so what's the behringer xenyx 502 like in this use scenario?1. the blue power light is blinding. first thing i did was put some masking tape on it so that it didn't prevent me from seeing the knobs on the board.2. speaking of those knobs, they seem a little rickety. be careful jamming this into a gig bag repeatedly. i worry that the knobs won't stand up to that kind of treatment for long.3. there's no on/off switch, so you'll wind up pulling the power out of the back of the unit when it's not in use. strange for this particular usage scenario.overall, i think this unit is a great value for the money.

Review: behringer products have a kind of shoddy reputation and i was skeptical about paying even [...] bucks for an 8-input mixer. my intention for this product was simple yet unorthodox: i wanted to use it for recording a drum set. i wanted to do it through my m-audio profire 610. i had 4 mics, 4 stands and a 5 piece drum set. i love my profire610 it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong. i have no gripe with it it's just that the preamp only works on two of the 6 inputs, so i figure if i get a mixer i can use its preamped channels and run them through the 1/4\" inputs on my interface. well, it worked. it worked great. not only did it sound great but i was able to have more control over the sound of each individual mic. low noise, great sound and i still had 4 1/4\" inputs on my mixer to play around with. with my drum set experiment over i now had an 8 input mixer at my disposal. add two monitors and you've got yourself a nice little pa. there are no BUS outputs so if you're serious about getting a descent mixer i wouldn't bother, but as a starter mixer for the price offered, i couldn't be happier. it works fantastic for small gigs or (god forbid) house parties.it may not be the prettiest looking mixer but its a very simple, self explanatory and effective mixer. i didn't need all the flash and the input/output jacks on the top is way better than running them out the back of the unit (i hate that!). the eq setup for each channel is basic: hi, mid, low, fx , pan and level. having an fx send is awesome when using it live. i didn't think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that. (the thing is only 9\"x7\") it's also got a control room output with volume which you can use for more monitors if need be ;) the xenyx 802 is a great buy. had i known i would like it this much i would have paid the extra $[...] and gotten the 12 channel one.

Review: great little mixing console for home use and practice.i use it at home and sometimes take it on the road for small gigs where i need to connect my guitar, a pair of cordless mics and a portable electronic drum kit.this thing has phantom power just in case you didn't read that already!overall i can say without hesitation that this unit is sturdy and packs all the necessary features you'd need and even has a british eq to help shape your sound a bit.cons? not many... one gripe about this unit is that it has no power button! i mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh? you have to disconnect the power adapter either from the power source or from the back of the mixer in order to take the device off. apart from that the led is wayyy too bright, so bright that you can't look at the device for very long and obviously can't make out the writing and control labels on the device. i notice all behringer pedals come with this bright led. what i usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led.i recommend getting this unit and only gave it 4 stars because of the few cons listed above.

Review: behringer makes quality products - i purchased the excellent c-1 condenser microphone, and replaced the 302usb with the xenyx 802 mixer board.when i researched items for a simple home recording setup, i saw all of the positive reviews for this smaller mixer, and read the item description here on amazon and the behringer website for the c-1 mic included what turned out to be a misleading statement about how it would work with any of the behringer phantom-powered mixer boards.that was incorrect information - this board receives power only via usb and doesn't provide adequate phantom power for condenser mics (48v).when i setup the return of this board to amazon, i informed of the error, and the appear to have acted very promptly on it, as the item description for the c-1 on both websites now includes an explicit statement about the need for 48 volts.although this correction is good, it would be more helpful to customers if behringer would also correct the description about this board associated with its wording about its phantom power capabilities to state what kinds of mics it will adequately power.i've noticed in other venues (i.e. musician and sound forums) behringer gets a bad rap. i don't think its due to poor quality equipment, i think its due to frustration about a lack of information provided to customers both before and after the sale. neither the behringer website nor the included documentation with the items i bought is adequate for customers like myself who are not sound experts.

Review: i've owned and used this product for some time now and am quite happy with it. i did notice that i had problems with an unpleasant humming introduced one time when using it with powered speakers, but i believe this was more so my fault than that of the unit. i learned that my active speakers did not care for input cables past a certain length. for greater distances, using a wireless transmitter to deliver the mixed sound and its matching wireless receiver connected to the speaker units solved this problem completely. the fx processor works flawlessly just as long as i remember to push down the selector to engage the desired function. very easy to use. compact in size. no ability to instantly mute an input device other than to turn down the gain. for the price ... what can you expect?!soon i will be in the market for an upgrade ... one that has slider controls and the ability to connect to my laptop via usb. i need a few more xlr inputs and at least a 7 band equalizer and compressor/limiter for larger gigs and a fairly large choral group and its accompanying instruments. just waiting for a good deal.

Review: the mixer is good for the price but i had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside. the packing way below average. as a matter of fact, it was the only outer box without any cushioning. after seeing those ups and fedex delivery videos i would not pack a ups or fedex shipping item in such a poor packing. however, the great seller ( i am referring to amazon) immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit. second unit too had the similar packing but no damages. worked fine.

Review: this was much smaller than i thought it would be but i kinda like that because it takes up no space. it does exactly what is expected of it. the effects are pretty good actually and could be used at a push for live or recording work - although certainly would not replace the likes of tc electronics or lexicon. relatively transparent and controls are responsive. for the money......good value.

Review: running 4 mics, samples and the odd phone call into one device for recording was a bit daunting. this mixer handles it all perfectly. i'm literally knew nothing about it when it arrived (first time i'd ever seen a mixer of any kind) in terms of usage but managed to figure it out quickly, get hiss free, nicely panned, beautifully warm sounds that have helped make my podcasting sound wonderful, professional and frankly better than i could have imagined. i didn't need the 'fx' .. but the the other was out of stock :d i'll get to them one day.i wish it had a power button.

Review: the mixer arrived early, which was a life-saver. i immediately put it to use at a musical venue in which all four microphone pre-amps were used for three vocalists and one flute, and the cd input was connected to a computer that was playing a minus track for the vocalists. everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs. i am looking forward to using more of the effects.

Review: i own the behringer xenyx 1202fx, which is essentially this model but costs about 20 dollars more for the fx (it comes with 100 set effects). i have been doing home recording with cubase and logic, using a presonus firebox audio interface, with both midi, vocals and instruments, and didn't use a mixing board, but eventually decided to try one out given that (a) they are making them at very reasonable prices and (b) i had more inputs and outputs than the firebox could easily handle.this mixing board didn't look that impressive to me when i first checked it out, but having set it up and used it, it operates very well and cleanly. the fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus. the fact that it does not have an on/off switch is a minus. but basically it works well, the eq is useful, and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer. behringer makes a range of models with less/more inputs to suit one's needs, so this is great. also, having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me, as i can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what i want to record. another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether -- you have to turn it down to zero. and, there are no faders (except the main); instead it uses knobs for everything. well, i would have liked some of these things, but then i would have to pay more, and what i really wanted was functionality at a good price, and that is what the behringer xenyx has delivered thus far.by the way, i am running the following through the mixer: an at3035 audiotechnica condenser mic, an alesis qs8.1, guitar via line-in (or mic'd), two krk rp5 studio monitors, presonus firebox. everything's been working and sounding great thus far.the effects on this mixer have not been very useful to me, since i am running logic, but if i ever use it live, which i may do, i'd imagine they'd come in handy. the effects are just so-so in terms of sounds: usable, but not that great, in my opinion.

Review: behringer has had a somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so i was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit but so far, so good. the mic preamps sound pretty good - clean and relatively quiet. the knobs and slider feel smooth and well made.it also seems to send hotter signal to my jbl eon 510s and that's a good thing.the built-in effects are probably its weakest point. i've heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit.i also wish that the control room knob and outputs were independent of the main output slider. that would definitely make it a lot more practical but then again, it would also turn it into a 4 buss mixer. so all in all, not too shabby for a $110 0 mixer but i probably wouldn't use it for recording.

Review: considering the price is so cheap on these, i took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. to say that i used it \"rarely\" is an understatement - maybe once a month when i have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vdrums and a bass di through my powered wedges. that said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume all the way up.aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. however, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero.

Review: i am giving this item 5 stars because it is awesome litle mixer, was not expecting much for the price but this little unit (it is very small) as i went from mackie 1202 to the berhinger 1202 (anyone see a similarity here), this is basically the same as the mackie mixer but slightly smaller, recieved it, hooked it up and it worked perfect, few minor adjustements and sounded as good as the mackie, perhaps better, plus it took up less space on my desk. only weird thing about this unit and it has been mentioned before is no ON & off switch, why?....problem solved by using a power strip and using the power strip to power the unit on and off, the only other way to power it on & off is by unplugging it from the back to turn it on, and plugging it back in to turn it on, using the power strip to avoid much wear and tear on the power source connector, this was really stupid of behringer, never ever had any kind of mixer without a power on & off button. all in all for the price, i should not complain much, will pick up another for my daughters studio as it is that good.

Review: when given a budget for cheap microphones, the odds are that you cant afford to make a mistake by buying this one. i like the fact that it adds a deeper, bassier tone to any voice but it's missing clarity. if you want the low tone but also treasure your clarity, spend 30 dollars less and get an mxl 990 instead. it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case. i hooked the 990 up to a cheap art tube mp preamp and after letting a few vocalists experiment with it, they agreed that the 990 was clearly superior to the v67g that was hooked up to much more expensive preamp. some vocalists actually prefer the mxl 990 over a couple of my shure condenser microphones.

Review: this mic is really nice. i have used it on many recordings and it still amazes me that it can sound so great. works great on voice overs, singers, and rappers.that said, it won't outperform the mics you would encounter in studios today, but with a little tweaking, and the right preamp, this mic can sound great.there was one review that mentioned it isn't for female vocalists. i've only used it on one and it sounded great, not as good as the one i used in studio, but it worked in a pinch for overdubbing with no studio time available.

Review: i am not a studio engineer, nor am i a professional musician. i record songs in my home as a hobby. i like to have reasonably nice gear in order to get as good a sound as possible in that setting, so if you're at or around the same level, you know what i'm talking about. will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much? no. are you likely to find it in a high-end professional studio? eh...probably not. is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point? hells yes.i've worked my way up in terms of mic quality as my hobby has gotten progressively more serious, and this is the nicest mic i own right now. the difference in quality between this and even a nice dynamic mic is immediately obvious. i use it for recording vocals, and my voice (again, not a pro!) is finicky to record, usually sounding pretty muddy. even with nicer dynamic mics usually used for vocals (sm57 and 58) this was still the case. but with this mic, my voice sounds much more clear and open.admittedly, this is a very subjective evaluation, but then aren't all mic evaluations subjective? you can go on all day about response range and eq flatness, but what matters in the end is how the mic sounds in your application. and to my ears, this mic sounds wonderful.my only real gripe is that the sensitivity pattern doesn't seem to be a super-tight cardioid, because it still picks up some sound coming from behind it. perhaps this is how it's supposed to be, but when trying to record both vocals and a loud electric guitar simultaneously, it can be a headache trying to jury-rig an isolation method that works. i took off a star for this alone, although that may not be fair since i haven't used any other large-diaphragm condensers and therefore have no idea if they're all supposed to behave this way.

Review: this mic is fantastic! i've been singing, writing, and recording for almost 30 years and this mic is pretty much just as good as all of the silly expensive german mics i've used in larger studios over the years. there's a very slight presence peak, but nothing like most of the other chinese mics. it isn't shrilling or peaky at all. male tenor vocals and acoustic guitar sound great without any need for eq whatsoever beyond a hi pass filter for the sub 100hz stuff. this mic is also an excellent candidate for a michael joly mod, he calls it one of the 7 audio wonders of the world because it makes no sense that this mic is this good at under $200. michael mods these mics and you'd be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference between this one and the famous u87 with the german name that starts with an \"n\". i'm using it totally stock and it's been great. buy it.

Review: i'm pretty new to using mics and pa systems but have used dynamic mics in the past, recreationally. this condenser mic is way larger and heavier than a dynamic mic, i was surprised when i took it out of the box. it is as good looking in person as in the pictures. three things for the benefit of other newbs: 1.) i learned that condenser mics are very susceptible to moisture and so you have to purchase a windscreen if you're going to use this for vocals, since moisture from singing into the mic can damage it. 2.) this has a cardioid pickup pattern; you don't sing directly into the end of the mic like a dynamic mic. this should stand straight up on a mic stand, paying attention to which way the mic is facing since it there will be a lot of attenuation on one side of it. 3.) it requires phantom power. you need a pa that provides 48v power to use it.when i first used this mic, i tried singing into the end of it and couldn't hear myself very well. later in the evening i was standing off to the side and could hear myself so loud that i had to back away about a foot from the mic. then i remembered reading about the cardioid pattern and stood it up straight on the mic stand, paying attention to the orientation of the mic. it was so sensitive that i really had to stay backed up from the mic and it was easy for two or three people to stand around it for vocals. i have a rainsong ws1100 acoustic electric guitar i was playing, and was able to turn off my amp completely because this mic picked up the instrument and my vocals so clearly. other musicians were impressed by it as well. i payed just under a $100 for it, which i think is a great value for this product.

Review: i love this boost pedal so much! i owned the mxr micro amp for a while, but i found that it colored my tone way too much (too much low end). the mc401 on the other hand doesn't color your tone at all. it provides a very precise boost and pushes your tube amp into natural overdrive. the boost is extremely articulate and produces throbbing palm muting and clear chords. if you're in the market for a boost or a buffer, i'd look no further. this pedal is affordable, sturdy, and sounds absolutely amazing!

Review: i play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solid-body bass. i bought this jim dunlop mc401 mxr because i have a few bass solos that can't be heard above the other players unless i boost volume, which was hard to do by reaching for the volume knob on my preamp or amp with my hand. this stomp box lets me instantly add a pre-selected amount of volume boost only--no goofy effects, no hum, no extraneous sounds at all. of course, when the solo is over, another click with my foot drops the boost. this thing sounds completely transparent when it's off, and completely natural when it's on. for my purposes, a boost of five decibels out of the 20 that this device permits seems to be enough. naturally, you have to have left some head room available in your amp otherwise you won't hear any volume change or you'll get distortion or both, but that should be obvious--it's just like turning your amp up, except with your foot.the mc401 runs on a 9-volt battery, but i also separately ordered the dunlop ecb003 ac adapter, which is also available at amazon. i checked the jim dunlop website and in its facs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter, so i did not order the ecb004, which is an 18-volt model. the ecb003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent.The mc401 is compacl, but it's heavily-constructed so it stays put. the stomp switch itself appears to be made of good steel, as is the case itself. everything is solid as a rock. i don't see how it could be better. perfect.

Review: i put two pickups in my resonator guitar, a magnetic and a transducer. this is the imd--improvised musical device--solution to using both pickups without building a little box with two volume controls. i plug two cords into the mixer, one from each pickup, and blend and balance the two pickups. it works. it cost a a little more than buying the parts to build something like an electric guitar wiring setup but it works out of the box so the labor cost is almost zero. bonus, it's an active device so it can boost the signal. only con is that it runs on 12 v and doesn't have a battery option. i can live with that.

Review: i have a pretty weird pedalboard set-up involving an ehx digital memory man looped back into itself and another split earlier in the pedal chain. this does a great job of summing three outputs back into one signal before i go into a reverb pedal and then out to my amp. takes a little while to dial in exactly where the knobs should be, and they get very loud at the top end, but i have noticed no issues with sound with each knob at around 4.5/10. i tested to see if i could tell any difference in noise due to this pedal but found none.

Review: these are amazing little inexpensive mixers. if you need to sum together some signals this can get the job done.we have two of these in our vocal effects rack summing our effects from six feeds (three per mixer) down to two outputs (one per mixer), the mixers feed direct boxes which go back to the front of house console, this lets us have the effects on stage so the performers can control them and send the signal back to the console for adding into the main mix. we have no noise problems at all with these mixers and they really solved a problem for me, i needed tiny flexible mixers i could preset and fit inside the rack out of the way, not only were these extremely inexpensive they work great.good luck and good music to all

Review: this liitle box works great for my needs. i am using three guitars on stage (when possible/room permitting.)and use this mixer to combine all three into one output to my amp. this way i can leave all three guitars plugged in and not have to take time between songs changing cords and such. it also solves a second problem: since the pick ups on each guitar have a different outputs (fender single coils, ibanez acoustic with fishman piezo and les paul gibson humbuckers), i now have volume controls that make the overall volumes match. this is perfect for that. inexpensive unit that is made of brushed aluminum and is quiet and adds a little boost to the signal that i velcro to my small pedal board..i'm glad someone else mentioned the a/c plug on theirs being european standard and not 110 volt us standard. don't be surprised if it happens to you. i bought one and had the same experience. i got mine from musicians friend. they offered to have me return it but i chose to keep it since i had a 12 volt power supply available from an older unit i long since stopped using. no stars deducted since it was not the manufacturers fault that my supplier didn't check their inventory to make sure it was us standard.

Review: s that complain about the low quality of behringer stuff and the plastic case on the effects pedals but i have yet to damage one of the pedals and i admit that i am not that careful with my live equipment. this stuff is the best bargain on the market. are my behringer eurolive active p.a. speakers as good as my mackie srm450 speakers. no, but the behringers cost about $250 0 each while my mackie's cost twice as much. if money is not a problem you should go with the bigger name brands but often at three to four times the cost and with only minor improvements.i am a weekly player and have been for 40 years. i wish this stuff had been around when i first started playing.

Review: not expensive. not cheap. not exactly what i wanted.like most all of the behringer items it has good points and \"duh\" points.if you use it as an a/b one input to 2 outs, then you can use the 2 volume controls. i did not need it for that.if you use it as 2 inputs and 1 out, you only control the sum out, not the individual inputs (thought you could, which is why i bought it. the 1/2 page twice translated fact sheet almost makes you think you can, but you can not.... i almost sent them back.. i bought 2 for a special set up needing to adjust the 2 input levels that i was switching).the led indicators when using it as a 2 in - 1 out (like 2 guitars into one amp, or in my case a mando and a midi-guitar rig into a single line in ) ... are ...exactly backwards... the one on the right (red) is actually the input on the left and the one on the left ( green) is the input on the right.... which makes it about as confusing to use as getting a weinersnitchel coupon that is good only at a sushi restaurant.operation wise, no hums, no buzzes but no one left on bass.when it is all said and done, i am glad i kept them.amazon rocks. got them in 3 days. free shipping. where else can you take the change you find in the couch to coinstar, get a coupon with no fee and buy musical toys. who said santa was a scrouge. i am just glad he took a nap and the money fell out of his pocket.

Review: do not let the size fool you. this is a very handy piece of equipment and it's so easy to set up and use. just plug a 1/4 inch stereo cable into your sub out on your mixer and then into the ha400, then plug in up to 4 pairs of headphones and your set to track overdubs. this is perfect for a small home studio on a budget and it's built like a tank. be forewarned that this a very basic headphone distribution system, you can only adjust volume from the ha400 and it would be wise to purchase a real long 1/4 stereo cable and extensions for the headphones if you want to isolate vocals.

Review: behringer doesn't have the best of reputations, but some of their gear does a great job at the price. this is one of them. this gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones. i run a project studio with an apogee duet as my interface. i needed this because sometimes i need to monitor something while another person in the room is recording/monitoring a track.my main headphones are beyerdynamic dt 770 pro, sennheiser hd 555, sony mdr-v6, and then i have some others. all of my headphones are comfortably driven by this headphone amp with plenty of gain on tap and i get very good volume, and even at the exact same volume as the input, i find that the sound is improved by using this headphone amp. it's hard to describe, but it just feels a bit fortified and a little bit stronger. i've had a presonus headphone amp before that cost many times as much as this little behringer headphone amp and the sound was no better.The volume pots are very smooth and there is no noise that i can hear that is introduced by this amp. make sure you use a quality sound source because this will faithfully amplify anything that goes in. for instance, if i run a cable from my imac's built-in headphone output to this amp and turn up the volume, i can hear a little buzz and random digital sounds, but that's not the amp, it's the source. running the output from my apogee duet, the sound is very clean and strong.there are some annoying things about this amp. obviously the external power supply is annoying, there's no on-off switch, and it's light enough that when everything is plugged in, it doesn't want to stay in place. however, that's nothing that velcro tape on the desk can't fix, and the rest of the problems are stuff you have to live with when you get something that does so much for less than the price of a decent pair of headphones.

Review: i'd bought this thing several years ago-forget where-as an alternative to the electro-harmonics stone phaser. the eh stone is great, but a) couldn't afford it 2)the adapter input is proprietary, differnt than was on my boss pedal board3)wasn't gigging out. so i figured, \"what the heck?\".i've had fun with it. with a wah and a proper guitar sound, one can easily emulate the hendrixish-univibe sound. remeber, guitar, touch, pickups, signal, etc all play into that factor. also its a 'vintage style', not a mid 80's mosquito tone killing device. not a huge range here. no swooshing jet sounds. just good 'ol wobble.i'll agree with the other guy here and say the durability is questionable, and the size of the thing is annoying by comparison to the standard pedal housing. and, it does make some noise in my chain. lately have been trying different cables, adapters, and batteries.a tinkerer/hobbyist/modder may enjoy getting a sturdy pedal housing box and putting this things guts into it, and, getting a sturdy switch. paint it all weird and call it a 'boutique pedal'.

Review: this device works. here's what it does. you plug an electric bass into the pedal's instrument input and then you can plug a second standard instrument cable into the pedal's high impedance output jack and then plug that one into a bass amp. you also can connect it to a low impedance microphone preamp via the 200 ohm low impedance xlr jack out. you can use just the high-impedance output or just the xlr output or you can use them both simultaneously. when the \"footswitch\" is off it functions transparently with no tonal modification at all just like a direct box. when the \"footswitch\" is on an led light activates and the tonal boost and tube emulation functions are on. i put \"footswitch\" in quotes because i use fingers to push it, but leave it on all the time for my personal purpose. when you insert a plug into the instrument input jack the unit powers on, so if running on battery be sure to unplug the input when not actually using it.some other functional comments about it. it runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9-volt power supply. i used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter. battery life isn't super but satisfactory. still if using it a lot, i suggest using an ac adapter. when the battery starts going it sounds awful, but you could put it into bypass mode to finish the set. also when the \"footswitch\" is off and the led is not lit, this thing functions as a straight xlr ouput direct box for anything you plug into it. you could patch the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal board to it and use that to feed a mixer for recording direct which is a very handy feature for the home recording hobbyist! the amp emulation and tone controls are wrong for anything other than electric bass, so just use it as a direct box with the tone/emulation circuit off for anything except bass.the controls are all rotary knobs except the ground-lift switch which is a slide switch. the controls left to right, top row to second row are: drive, treble, bass, level, presence, ground lift slide switch and blend.taking each control one at a time to understand what they do is important because they are not all logically placed. the drive knob adjusts the amount of gain similar to cranking the input stage control of the tube preamp and here is where you can get something like the tonal thickness (or edge) of overdriven tube tone. basically this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some of the more pleasing distortion out there for this purpose. there is no ACTIVE/PASSIVE pad switch or extra active input jack on this pedal so if you have an active bass then you will not have to turn the drive knob up as much to get the tone you want. the treble knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of upper frequency tones. the bass knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of the lower frequencies. 12 o'clock is flat (or zero db boost or cut) on both the treble and bass knobs. the level knob is the master volume control and all it does is control the output volume with no tonal coloration. the presence knob boosts the upper frequency range harmonic content for more attack in your tone. the presence knob isn't a midrange control, but does boost the upper mids. the ground lift switch only effects the xlr output jack and it should be left \"off\" unless you hook it up and there is hum. then you can turn the ground lift \"on\" and it might help eliminate the hum issue. however it is better from a safety standpoint to remedy this by eliminating the electrical ground loop conflict that is causing the hum. the blend knob controls the amount of tube emulation injected into the pedal's output with all the way to the left being none, 12 o'clock being 50% and all the way clockwise being 100%.cons: very little bass gear, or anything else, is \"perfect\" these days. behringer gear has more build issues in general across most of their product line because using chinese parts and labor is how they keep costs down. designed in germany but built in china means you get chinese components and chinese build quality while the specs look pretty enticing. for example at the first battery change the battery clip self-destructed as part of the clip's terminal stayed stuck to the battery having pulled completely out of the clip. this was a duracell battery, the standard for pedal batteries. went to radio shack and got replacement battery clips and fixed it with a new clip by soldering wires from the new clip to the stripped wires cut away from the old clip and taping up the solder joint. i've never used this as a stompbox because the switch looks like it will break if you lean on it hard. construction is all plastic. the casing is very durable but based on previous experience with plastic switches on stomp boxes i know not to use my size 13-d foot on it. the treble and presence knobs on mine will generate hiss and noise when set very high which may not be noticeable at all on a vintage type bass amp with no tweeter but becomes glaring when using a full range amp and cabinet or when using the xlr output for recording or a pa feed. basically i set the treble and presence to the point where i hear hiss start, then back off until it goes completely away because that is the functional limit. hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off. the jacks, other than the xlr, are the plastic box jacks that are soldered direct to the circuit board of the pedal, these type jacks are noted for causing problems, especially after rough use so take it easy with them and they should last a very long time. this unit lacks any dedicated midrange knob but the presence knob does seem to boost upper mids and treble simultaneously. some people who use this pedal as a stage-tool use it as a solo or \"scoop\" switch for slap & tap solos so the presence, bass and treble boost are basically all you need for a solo switch anyway.pros: first and foremost the price is almost too good to be true when you consider the price for anything else with similar features, but keep in mind that it has durability issues so be gentle with it and it will last indefinitely. this isn't a tech 21 nyc bass driver by any means, but works in a similar fashion to one. i have a tech 21 bass driver deluxe that i use at gigs. the tech 21 sounds better but costs about eight times what the behringer cost. i use the behringer at home and save that wear on my pedal board at home. if i didn't have the tech 21 unit i might take this unit to gigs, but it probably will last way longer the way i keep it setup at home all the time. i especially like this unit when used with small rehearsal/practice type combos. many of these smaller combos have passive type tone circuits that basically are at flat when the tone is cranked wide open and this device really makes these little amps sound more serious. part of the beauty of an active bass is the tone boost capability you don't get in a passive bass and if you have a passive bass this can make it sound more like an active bass with the treble and bass boost in front of the amp. it is also useful for boosting a signal in front of a longer cable run to the backline, say anything over about 18 feet. for recording the xlr direct out is very useful and the xlr direct out can also be used to feed the pa at a gig if your amp doesn't have a xlr direct out.how i use this device: i have my bass guitar plugged into the input and use the xlr output to connect it to a microphone mixer. the output from microphone mixer is patched into a turtle beach santa cruz soundcard in an xp computer. i can then record using the computer's recording software, practice solo or i can play along to recorded music using headphones. with headphones i can play as loud as i want anytime that i want without disturbing anyone. most computer speakers are very inadequate for electric bass, so i recommend headphones instead of your typical desktop computer speakers. you can buy better computer speakers that are capable, but they will cost about the same or actually more than a decent bass guitar practice combo amp. quality headphones cost far less than quality powered computer speakers that are bass guitar capable.having owned this pedal for about 4 years and knowing what i know about it, i would buy it again. i would strongly recommend it as a home recording/practice tool but my recommendation as a stage tool is not as strong. for home use it is fine. you can use it at gigs but i'd be saving up \"gig bones\" to buy something more durable with better performance.

Review: i'm primarily a guitarist, but i keep an inexpensive sx bass around for when i'm self-recording and whatnot. since it isn't my primary instrument and i don't play bass live (well, not yet), it never made sense to invest in a bass amp. i bought this to liven up the tone when recording, in the hope of removing some of the sterility of a bass plugged directly into a firewire interface. it does the job; makes the sound warmer and more amp-like.honestly, if you've been doing some homework about this thing, you should know what to think of it. behringer's build quality can be dubious sometimes, but overall their stuff produces sounds that should satisfy anyone who isn't a picky audiophile. this box is no exception. i've never personally played through a sansamp, but i would hazard a guess that if you know that's what you want, this won't satisfy you. if you want something like a sansamp you could do a lot worse than venture the 30-some bucks on this little box.to my ears, it sounds quite good. get it if it fills a need for you and you're broke. knocked off a star for behringer's usual build quality, although mine hasn't broken from gentle use yet.

Review: i used this for a while, but now i have the behringer 8ch rack mount and this rarely gets used. also, every single bass guitar amplifier that has been on stage when i was the soundman had a balanced direct output right with xlr connector right there on the amp. i still use this for practice at home.

Review: i have an acoustic b100 mkii 100 watt bass amp with a 15 inch speaker. my bass is an sx jazz bass. i have always loved the tone of my acoustic amp, until now. after i plugged this little bad boy in, it brought my amp to life! now, i cannot live without it. this is the swiss army knife of bass preamps. every bass player should have one of these. you can dial in tons of different tones and it gives your amp that tube-like sound. for 29 bones, you simply cannot beat it! spend the extra 10 bucks and get the behringer 9v power supply, so you don't have to worry about batteries. if you are a bass player, just buy it!!!

Review: i own numerous behringer products and have never had an issue with any of them.this item is well worth the money and the sound is awsome, which is what you want. who cares if it is plastic.i own a behringer x v-amp guitar multi effects pedal and when i first plugged into it, the quality of the amp models blew me away.to the guy who said he received one with stripped out screws and to not even think about stepping on the pedal... dude, it sounds like you were sent a returned product that someone messed with. you should have been bright enough to just return it and ask for a replacement. second, these are musical instruments. you aren't supposed to stomp on them like you are trying to crush them and grind them into the stage... or where ever you play. the term 'stomp' box isn't supposed to be taken literally. it simply means you push the pedal button with your foot. erego, the word stomp.

Review: what can you say... at less than $30(incl shipping), it's a steal! i was looking for a very inexpensive version of the popular sansamp, and this does it for me. decent svt, flip top or \"fat tube\" tone, and a nice quiet di. i go di to the house, and the output into my old seymour duncan amp/aguilar gs410 cab. great tone!! i'm using a 9vdc class ii wall wart (found it in my \"spare parts\" closet) vs 9v batteries. with the wall wart, no DI hum = great! does eat batteries, so get yourself a power supply. never use the foot switch; if used at all, i use my finger. if broken or lost(who would steal it?), i'd buy another in a heart beat!

Review: does as described and really enhances your tone. good breadth of tonal variations available. only negative, and it's not huge, is that it can get a little noisy when the presence is increased beyond half. i was using a bass with two single coils which makes noise more of a challenge to begin with.

Review: i bought the hell babe 10 years ago, it was my first wah pedal and it has been on my pedal board ever since, the same one. i have never had a major problem with it, the boost knob fell off a couple years ago but it was plastic and i did kick it a lot over the years so no big deal. its no crybaby and im glad, it has its own sound that i have tried to get out of my vintage crybaby but couldn't no matter how much i tweaked it. i actually run both my crybaby and my hell babe on my pedal board and i find myself using the hell babe way more, especially since it has the auto off and spring back. it really makes my solos rip. buy it, you will have a ball. my only complaint is that the spring is loud and audible when playing acoustic gigs but acoustic guitar sucks so whatever.....

Review: if you want an eq pedal right away to tweak guitar/keyboard sounds, this think is great. people are trying to hate on this, but it is fine, i was expecting the worst from the reviews, but still wanted it so i got it anyway. you don't need the adapter they push (the behringer brand 9v), best way to work with this is turn all bands all the way down, then just go up with each one till you get the guitar sound you like, then you can turn it off during this test to go back to your \"default/normal sound\" to hear the difference. it works nicely, and for the price it was a steal. in the future i may get a more expensive one, this seems fine for now.

Review: if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. pay the extra money and get something quiet. others complained about this and they were right. if you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. some complained about each band boosting others. this is more of a user problem than manufacturing. if you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. in this respect, its like an mxr 6 band.

Review: whatever the name, this pedal is from the ibanez tube screamer camp. the packaging description says it uses the jrc4558 chip and ma150 diodes, and yes, behringer got the sound right. i'd say this competes well against any of the modded ts pedals. what i love about this pedal is the tone knob. for the ts pedals in this price range, it's the most useful. you can set it high, and it isn't too icepicky, yet the entire range is useful. this is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound.i prefer this pedal for boosting my gain in a hot amp or pedal, or another overdrive. it works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones. it could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones.i bought this pedal to \"semi-retire\" an older ibanez ts5 soundtank. the switch on that one isn't as good as the behringer's. the behringer has a much smoother action to it when turning the pedal on or off. i use mainly solid state fender amps, and several distortion pedals (including a boss metal zone). i'd bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt. the only downside is the slight lack of bass. if you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups (esp. 2x12 and 4x12), or a distorted tone with plenty of bass, this shouldn't be a problem.

Review: i had a boss blues driver pedal that i really liked, that is until i got this behringer tube overdrive. for blues, you (or at least i) want a gritty, dirty sound, one that implies some of the hurt implicit in blues music. i was happy with the boss, but i decided to try this b. pedal, and i'm glad i did. i compared them side-by-side, and the tube overdrive was much grittier, like a small tube amp pushed just past its clear sounding limit. it's perfect for the sound i want, and i can adjust the amount of distortion to my preference. some like a lot of that sound, but i prefer just enough to color the sound and shape it to my desires, leaving the rest to my playing and the dynamics of how i attack the strings.i've now retired the boss pedal. in a careful comparison, the boss had a cleaner and slightly more clear sound, which is not really an overdrive, but more of a distortion, but a clear distortion, if that makes any sense. it does add sustain, but it can't compare with the b. pedal's effect, which implies a power barely held in check, just exactly what i was after.

Review: what can i say that you haven't already read about this amazing pedal? if you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal. if your looking to play out with it know that it's cheaply made and can be destroyed in seconds. have a backup. take great care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal. that alone can cause problems... as far as tone goes it rates very high on the tone god list. you can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal. it has out muscled my 2 other more expensive name brand overdrive pedals and yes it has earned a permanent spot on my pedalboard. i use it mostly as a clean boost so the pedal is always on and i never turn it off once we start playing. i leave it plugged in on the board all the time. i reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off. i carry a backup pedal... i love this pedal!...just don't ever drop it...

Review: s for the to-800 are uniformly favorable. based on this, i purchased one instead of paying many times more for an ibanez ts-808. this proved to be a good decision. the to-800 produces exactly the sort of sound enhancement that made \"seasick green\" justly famous: creamy smooth to raunchy depending on my whim.the same sound for a lot less money? what's the catch? i'm a musical hobbyist. the to-800 will sit safely on my office floor and, most likely, never be actuated by my foot. the behringer's shoddy plastic case and flimsy little control knobs, for me, are not liabilities. if i was a gigging musician on the other hand, i'd want the tank-solid construction of \"the real thing\" and its additional cost would be well justified.

Review: the pedal works as described. the draw back is the battery installation. you have to take the pedal off to access the battery. the other thing is if you forget to unplug the input cord from your guitar the battery drains when not in use. i purchased a power supply to go along with it. the problem with that is the power supply is one more thing to find a plug in for. it's ok for the money and works good. i run it wide open and have the amp gain pretty high also to get the retro sound i am looking for. i mainly use it with a large body &#34;f&#34; hole guitar with a set of very heavy flat wound strings. the lows with vibrate the fillings out of your teeth!

Review: this pedal is based on the famous ibanez ts-808 pedal. my hat's off to behringer for doing an excellent job of recreating the classic sound in an affordable package. i don't own the ts-808, but i do own a ts-9, and while the ts-9 does offer a nice gritty overdrive overdrive that has enough bite to bring your tone out in a mix, the ts800 offers a warmth and a sweetness that i've simply fallen in love with. several of the classic tubescreamer characteristics are audibly present: slightly rolled off bass and a bit of a mid-range hump, with a tone control that offers useable tone at any setting. i usually max out the level knob and adjust the drive know to taste(which never exceeds 12 o'clock); i've found that this setting gives my tone the most body and depth. i use this pedal primarily with my jet city jca20h head just to \"pump\" it up a little bit. this combination takes me straight into guns 'n roses (or that type of 80's/90's-era rock) territory.used over a clean tone the ts800 offers a very warm, smooth, bluesy overdrive that can either be more of a clean boost or add some grit depending on where you set the drive knob.the pedal is made of plastic, and while it seems solid enough, it's the only area where this pedal really merits any criticism. but considering that behringer is offering this pedal for [...], it's clear that in order for behringer to offer such great tone at such a low price, sacrifices in build quality had to be made. that being said, i don't feel concerned at all that this pedal will suddenly break on me; don't be too rough with it and it should last a good while.

Review: i am not a giging muscian or even a serious player. i play for fun and relaxation. i have been playing for about 10 years but only in the past 2 years have i taken up the electric gutiar. i have a very simple amp setup with a fender starcaster 15 g as my practice/ backup amp and a fender mustang 1 20watt as my main amp. i love the mustang, but have always found the starcaster kinda weak (well duh it is a simple practice amp). i have 2 very basic guitars (a jay turser m300 series and an epi lp special ii). i normally only use the mustang but latly have found myself really appreciating the simple clean sound that the starcaster can give, but it is a one hit wonder. i am constantly switch amps and is was getting tiresome. i order this pedal on a whim thinking that it might add a little depth the the starcaster and i might be more inclined to use this amp more. boy did i hit a home run with that! the pedal arrived and i spent an hour playing with it on the starcaster. the depth and fullness it adds to this little amp is amazing. it truely gives it a tube crunch but yet retains the nice clean sound when the levels are backed off. flip the overdrive button on the starcaster and this amp become a distortion monster. yea i know i can't imagine what this pedal would do on a &#34;real&#34; amp! i also found that i'm getting better response with my guitar tone knob too. that was always an issue with this small amp- the tone knob made very little difference. not anymore. i can spin the knob and go from clean to dirty and back again. yup this is a winner for all you practice amp only people. just for s and g's i plugged this into the mustang (set on brittish 60's red) and turned the levels way down. amazingly it backed the crunch and distortion way off from this setting (so now i can go clean without having to touch the amp!) all the reviews have stated how nicely this pedal works on the upper settings but it was great to find out that it can be used effectively to clean up a dirty channel! i look forward to playing with this some more on both amps.no for the nuts and bolts of the thing. yup plastic. well i'm very gentle on my gear (this sits on a table next to me and is activated with my hand) so i don't expect issues, but if i was a thrash metal rocker i would probably look elsewhere for durability. don't drop it or jump on it and it should last a lifetime. the switch activation is very positive and easy to manipulate. no issues there. the dials are easy to read and turn smoothly. the led is a nice level of brightness and does not flicker. i'm using the ac adaptor so no ideas on battery life or replacement. the box is heavy enough to stay in place, but lite enough that i could easily toss it in a gig bag and not worry about it damaging a guitar. cable plugs are rugged and seem like they will last a lifetime. i left the unit plugged in overnight and there was no desernable heat in either the adaptor or the pedal. after palying for an hour the pedal was still cool to the touch as was the adaptor.my biggest complaint has to do with amazon itself. i got this for twenty bucks shipped. amazon gave an estimate of 10 days to arrive!!! 10 days! yea it was coming from vegas to ny but 10 days!! 15 days later it finally arrived. 15 days!!!! more than 2 weeks. half a month!! i'm pretty sure ups surepost had a guy walk it to ny. i don't know what the big delay was all about but i was horribly bummed about shipping times. i ordered a few other items with this (ac adaptor and 5 ft insutment cable to use with this) and they arrived 4 days later.all in all this is a great pedal. outstanding for those of us with simple equipment and on a tighter budget. if you have a simple practice amp and want more out of it, then grab one of these pedals and be prepared for amazment that so much sound can come from a little package.

Review: i was unsatisfied with the tone from either of my two used solid-state amps, so i ordered a vht special six (supposed to be the best small tube amp for blues harp), i also ordered a peavey kb2 (solid state keyboard amp). then i ordered this pedal and three others (graphic equalizer; mxr carbon copy delay; t-rex reverb) i figured that i would find a good tone for both blues and other music from something within this combo. well everything is being returned except this pedal. i found that when i plug this pedal into my old 8 watt peavey rage, i get better tone and volume than either of the two new amps using them alone or with any combination of the four pedals. more \"tube-like\" sound than a top-rated tube amp! and...if i want a cleaner tone, i can dial it back, or bypass it altogether. my only complaint is that it does not accept a battery. you must use a 9v transformer, which is not included. oh well, my experience with the other pedals was that a battery does not last long anyway. yes, it is made of plastic, but if you are reasonably careful, that should not be a problem. update: i just found that by plugging into both the high and low jacks (at the same time) on the vht amp, it now produces \"the sound\". i will keep the vht and use it instead of my peavey rage with this pedal. the sound from either set-up is pretty close, but the vht requires less fooling around with adjustments, and is more resistant to feedback. i still might keep this pedal though, cause it's easily the next best thing to the vht special 6 tube amp.

Review: this pedal, used in conjunctions with a host of others on my board ('the labyrinth'), does what it claims to do and more. it seriously boosts the instrument signal from my tele at a mere 50% level setting and makes the subsequent mxr distortion + pedal crackle with goodness and increased sustain. i've purchased a host of behringer guitar pedals during the last year (used, i might add) and am happy with every single one of them. don't let the cheap price fool ya. i've been using all manner of guitar pedals in my work since the 1970's - yes, i'm \"old\" - and these stack up against anything similar that more expensive manufacturers have to offer. i'm just glad that i'm getting most of them for under $50 before the world figures out how reliable they are and behringer jacks the price of everything. oh yes, i use a onespot 9v multi-adapter to power everything, so i cannot comment on how quickly these pedals plow through batteries. good stuff!

Review: that said this pedal had a noticable hiss. since i didn't remember hearing any, i got it out at home and plugged it into my amp (i have the same amp at home that i use live). when you activate it with the tone set flat on the pedal and the volume about 12:00, there is a very sight hiss (no noise when bypassed). for me it is a very minor hiss that in live situations with all the normal room noises i never heard at all. this may not be true for all amps and maybe some high gain input amps may handle this signal differently. i know for sure it is a lot quieter than almost any effects pedal i have ever owned and i have box full from 35 years of playing. i am using a vox vt30 which is a modeling amp with lots of bulit in effects (delays, chorus, flanger, compressors etc.) these days i don't use any additional outboard effects (except a bba sonic stomp that i never turn off) so siganl from my guitar hits my amps input very cleanly. if you use various guitars on gigs, this pedal is very useful. it allows me to quickly match the various guitar output levels and compensate for differences between humbuckers, single coils and piezo pick ups on an acoustic without having to adjust the amp controls. this is a great problem solver for any rig that needs to control the input level to the amp and it does it at a bare bones price.i have owned several behringer pedals for live work and have some behringer rack gear in my live audio rack and in my home studio. i gig reguarly once to twice a week faithfully. i have never broken or had a problem with any of my behrinnger gear (including a pair of behringer 12\" powered speakers mixed with a pair of mackie 15\" powered mains). i don't intentionally abuse my gear but at 2:00 when your packing up s happens but so far my behringer stuff has never let me down yet and i have had some it for many years. i also keep reading about people worrying about the hard plastic cases on behringer pedals. don't worry about it. they are sturdy enough. (just watch out if you are changing the battery on a dark stage. the battery goes under the pedal switch and the spring that is under the foot switch will probbaly fall out if you are not careful. (to open the battery compartment/foot switch cover just use a pen or small phillips style jewelers screwdriver and push in the black pins on either side of the pedal.)

Review: i purchased a budget passive soundhole pickup for a guitar i bring to a local open mic.to get any volume from it the sound guy had to boost the channel very high and the sound was still a bit thin. i found the behringer pb100 and after reviewing various posts about it as well as checking out the youtube demos of the device i purchased it. i used it for the past four weeks at the open mic and have been impressed with how it boosts the sound without effort. i can add a bit of bass which makes the guitar finally sound as it should too. this pedal makes the budget pickup sound like a much more expensive pickup now.

Review: item body is plastic rather than metal. this is to be expected at this price. i would not call it \"sturdy\" but at least it's $25 instead of $125, and it works. professional musicians may not be impressed as there are some occasional noise issues (as i've found to be true with many behringer products). nevertheless for what it is... it works reasonably well.received this item in good time. there's only one real dislike i have about the item: the battery access is... goofy. to access the battery one must take the foot pedal off by \"inserting an ink pen into the hinges\". two hinges, two hands... a tricky process at best. not the easiest battery access i've ever seen. however to be fair, relatively minor issue and not insurmountable. i became relatively skilled at it in short time.initially the product didn't work. all i could hear was static out of the amp and thought i had a defective unit. but then i noticed the gain was turned up right out of the box. turned it down and the sound got much better. traced an additional problem to an old unshielded guitar cable; replaced that with a good one and sound smoothed out.this is a sensitive unit, with a wide gain and tone range. it has excellent bass and treble tuners. it did seem to be somewhat sensitive to movement noises so apparently there is no noise filter of any kind in the box. jiggling of guitar cords could cause static and cut-out. that could be cord issues or box issues. i'll experiment more later.it does have some hiss that is easily audible in a room environment. behringer seems to have a problem with hiss in their products, dunno why. but once the sound comes out it's difficult to discern the hiss; it's not extremely loud or annoying... it's just there.bottom line this is a cheap unit at a cheap price. it does the job and should work fine for most instances where such a device would be needed (such as with passive pickup--non powered acoustic instruments). i'd recommend it for those who need such a thing simply because of the relative ease of use (foot petal on-off switch) and the relative low cost.It's just so-so in my estimate, but in some cases so-so is good enough. : )

Review: was a great problem solver for me but almost exactly one year after getting it the volume died. useless now. i used the \"line\" input (to tap into an aux feed that got recorded) as it came off a live board. for the price i guess i shouldn't complain too much. behringer often means trading price for longevity as the qc seems to be very hit and miss. so now time to decide; do i resign myself to replace it every year or get something mo betta?note: this is a low end, but still \"pro audio,\" piece of a equipment. and while it truley doesn't get super loud, for people who say it barely does anything volume wise i have to wonder if they are using it with home audio equipment? if so, your signal strength going into the unit is likely well below the +4dbu \"line level\" signal that pro gear offers. subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with. and as a result are getting poor volume plus the added \"bonus\" of increased distorion and/or floor noise when you do try and crank it up.update: well it works some days and not others it seems- so a i keep it around for now as i am having more good days than bad days with it lately. can't really see a rhyme of reason to it- connections don't seem loose or intermitant or anything like that- i just either have good volume or it craps out??? it is in one permanent location, used exacty the same way every time- so it's never a matter of a different configuration or using it with different gear.

Review: i bought this headphone amp for in the isolation booth of my recording studio. the idea was to give the vocalist/instrumentalist personal control over their own levels, without the engineer having to change any settings manually. the item works great for that, as long as you're not using a powered microphone. if you are using a powered microphone you get a crazy loud buzzing, and interference when the monitor, and microphones are plugged in. plus, the hum/buzz is so loud you can't hear anything from the microphone. the only way i've gotten rid of the buzz is by running an unbalanced mic cable from the headphone amp to a direct box, and then into the board. i'm told that a hum eliminator would do the trick, but that's another $40-$100 i really wasn't planning on forking out. i'd rather have the engineer change the levels for the vocalist/instrumentalist than pay an extra $100 at the moment. again, it's very good at what it does, if you don't power the microphone.

Review: one of the big selling points for this unit was the sound quality and the need for no drivers. well - after starting to use it on windows 7 x64 i was dismayed to find simply awful electrical interference and buzz in recordings. i went to the behringer website, i found the product page, found a tab for drivers, downloaded them and boom .... all my problems were solved but that had taken me days and days. needless to say that portion of the marketing is crap - drivers are absolutely required if you use windows 7. i am using this with a behringer 1202fx mixer - it is a good combo. the build quality is nothing to shout about but even though the enclosure is plastic if feels sturdy enough. i treat my gear with care - i figure it'll probably last for years and years and years. i am extremely happy, and hopeful that somebody will read this review and skip to the drivers immediately upon installation.

Review: it's hard to argue with this when you consider the price they charge for what it does. it works and it's by far and away the best cheap option to go when you want to record audio to your computer.i use it with audacity. at first, i found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss. after fooling around for a couple hours trying to figure it out, i thought it was just because the audio interface was a cheap product. the next day, i fooled around with it more and realized i needed to turn the mic input down (in audacity) and turn up the gain halfway on my mixer. when i did this, it completely shut out the hiss. i've been making great recordings since.it's a plug and play tool, but it should come with some kind of instructions for problems like i experienced. however, they are just a matter of setting up your computer properly because this thing works very well.For those wondering about latency, obviously there's some. you'll get latency with any type of recording device. you just have to account for it in the settings of your audio editing program.the only other thing that is a legit complaint is that playback is a bit noisy and hissy in the headphones if you have the headphones turned up high. it does not sound like that in the recordings, though. so, it's ok. i can deal with itthis is a very good product and can't be beat for the price. when it comes to quality, you have to set it up correctly. when you do set it up properly, the quality is fantastic. it would be nice if there was some kind of troubleshooting guide that came with it, though.

Review: i'm reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my behringer 802 xenyx mixer, and i finally did after nearly throwing in the towel. turns out i was using my mixer's cd/tape switch incorrectly, thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback. i finally went on you tube and found a behringer guy that has a video that's less than 2 minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer. just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple i was doing wrong - i was over-thinking it. once i got it to working correctly, i could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly, including the control on my pc that controlled the recording volume for this unit. so, now i'm looking forward to doing some real recording with it, using audacity as my main recording software. (edit: i did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really, really pleased with the results - i can hardly wait to do some more recording with this. so, to the arrogant salesman who bad-mouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a $150 0 lexicon unit, i won't be needing that - i'm quite happy with this little interface, thank you very much. and to everyone else, don't forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your pc and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock on-board sound card. thanks behringer, this is a great value!!

Review: i own two of these behringer boxes (they come in two modals) and use them with sonor/cakewalk and an internal software sound modual (roland virtual sound canvas) to play back midi files with my live two piece band. the sound through the pa (soundcraft mixer and mackie active speakers) is loud and very clear, in most cases, no eq needed. i guess it really revolves around your personal needs. for live performance these behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal. i do not use it to record as my home recording is done on a stand alone daw (tascam 2488 24 track).if you are a live musician or a dj using something like virtual dj these boxes are a great way to eliminate low level hum from a laptop and give you a dramtically better sound than most internal laptop sound cards.

Review: i picked this simple interface up back in 2007 and i can attest that it still works flawlessly after all these years! it's been gigged, dropped, and even rained on, however it still sounds great and functions perfectly. i was using this as my laptop interface and when combined with the free asio4all driver, i was able to get anywhere between 5ms and 10ms latency. under windows 7, it was plug and play with the default wdm driver, however to really take advantage of capabilities, you'll want to install asio4all, especially if you're using ableton, fl studio, energyxt, etc. all and all, the uca202 is pretty limited, however it does allow you to easily get audio into and out of your pc. for the functionality alone, it's definitely worth asking price!

Review: let me begin with a public service announcement: if you want to buy other ezdrummer expansion packs, you need to buy this product first! important update toontrack is scheduling the public release of ez drummer 2 in may 2014. if you buy ez drummer 1 from now until then, you will also get the download for 2 . bear in mind, ezd2 is a completely new/different program from ezd1, and so i would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock ezd1 pop/rock kit (which has some very kit pieces) in addition to the ezd2 default kit (which is more reminiscent of the rock! expansion kit from what i've seen). ez drummer 2 also gives you the ability to mix/mash kit pieces from all expansions, and so to me this makes ez drummer a must buy based on the sheer customization available. resume normal programming if you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit, ezdrummer is probably the best bang for the buck you'll find. it's very easy to use, very easy to program, and overall a well made product. you might be tempted to compare ezdrummer to its bigger and better brother: superior drummer 2 , made by the same company. superior drummer is superior to ezdrummer, but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact close-to-life sounding virtual instrument.there are ways to improve the off-the-shelf sound quality of ezdrummer immediately. youtube has plenty of video tutorials on this, but what you want to do is open up your digital audio workstation (pro tools, cubase, etc), and set ezdrummer for multi-track output. from there you'll be able to tweak the different outputs ezdrummer has as if you were in a studio and had 7 mics at your disposal. most high-end professional studios use about 10 mics to capture everything on a drum kit, and so 7 virtual mics is nothing to scoff at: kick drum, snare top and bottom, toms, cymbals, overhead, and room. once you have each of those outputs running, you can perform individual eqs to change the tone dramatically. adding a touch of distortion/gain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound really close-to-life. in reality, once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced, it only takes a trained ear to tell that it's a virtual kit.as far as the expansions go, if you are looking to record a particular style of music, then i highly recommend buying the ezx kit that goes with that genre. the stock rock kit is very GOOD (after performing the mods above)... but only for rock. as for me personally, i did my best to eq and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone, but in the end, i found the rock kit lacking, especially since it's a \"tight\" kit (3 toms, 3 cymbals, 1 hi-hat, 1 snare, 1 kick).

Review: i write and record my own music. i stink at writing drums. i don't play drums, i don't really have room for a drumset, and i really don't want to spend the money on a drumset to see if i can figure it out. this is a great program for non-drumming, one man bands like me. midi drums and the drum sounds from my yamaha keyboard just wasn't cutting it. it works with ableton live 9 with no problems. tons of different grooves. it sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset. very easy to use.

Review: the software itself (sound/interface): 4.5 starsthe installation and activation: 2 starspros:1) the drums included in ez drummer are the most realistic review s i just thought the people complaining about the install/activation were being wusses. i mean seriously, how hard can it be? well, they were right, it sucks. it took me two hours to get it all working.my advice: don't even install the app from the included disc. instead, just go create yourself an account at toontrack.com and download the most up-to-date version and all the patches for the modules that come with it.my experience:1) try to install from disc. fails with a 1308.2) google'd the problem. found out i needed to get a toontrack.com account and download the installer from there.3) downloaded the ~650 mb zipped installer. then, i had to unzip the 18,000 files, which took about 20 minutes on my pc.4) i was finally able to install it and then had to download three other updates to the modules within the install.5) then i had to jump through one final hoop to active it (take this key copy it here, then copy this here, stand on your head, etc..).great software, horrible install.~slick

Review: a breeze to install on my mac mini, simple to use with garageband. the bad reviews here are bizarre, written by inept people who either can't handle the install or have a buggy pc or os. i was up and running 5 minutes after i tore off the shrink wrap from the packaging.there's plenty of specs/details/videos on the interwebs about this software, go do some research, see if you like it. it's way better than the drum kits that come with garageband and there's plenty of kits to expand with. i got the vintage rock kit and i love it - almost as much as i love pizza, which i will marry some day. i like a cheese pizza. some call it \"plain\" but with the right blend of sauce, cheese and crust, there's nothing plain about it - it's somewhat complex, much like myself. we are a perfect match, pizza and me. we go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom. i'm not exclusively a thin crust guy, sometimes i dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dish.the only weak point in this pizza i mean software is that you can't do a cymbal swell. apparently, it's the same with all these virtual kits, regardless of brand, but it would be nice if someone (toontrack) would address it by including a \"side stick\" attack on the crashes. if you try to do a cymbal swell, you hear the initial stick-on-cymbal \"ting\" with each attack, so it's kind of a \"ting-ting-ting-ting\" sound instead of \"bwooooosssshhhhh.\" i'm sure i can find a bwoosh loop without a ting-ting. bwoosh loop - no ting-ting. do i get a fortune cookie with that?pizza time!ohhh, myyyy loooove... my darlin'... i hun-ger for.... your crust....

Review: i could go on and on for days, but the best things about ezd are the endless ezx packs you can add in and the fact that all drum grooves have a mic on each drum as well as room and overhead mics which give you that live, organic sound that you can never get with loops.you can edit the grooves and fills via midi if you need too, add in cymbals, etc. it's really, really an amazing program. best money i ever spent!

Review: for anyone who has had the experience of a strap coming off at the most inopportune time and seeing your baby go crashing to the floor only once, is enough to justify a strap lock system of some kind. i mount my guitars on the wall when they are not being used, so i wanted a strap that can be put on and taken off easily. anyone who removes and reinstalls their strap knows that it does not take long for those eye holes to become loose. also, i didn't want to have short &#34; strapletts&#34; dangling from my guitars while it's being displayed. so for the couple bucks they cost and 10 minutes, i get everything i wanted. quick release and reattach of the strap, the piece of mind that it's not going to just randomly drop one day, and they come in all the standard finishes, chrome, black, gold, nickle and they do not detract from the visual artistry of the guitar while on display. i have these on all my guitars and always will. as an added bonus, once you have these on multiple guitars, you can quickly swap out straps as often as you change your underwear.

Review: when i first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune. mainly the second to the last string at the bottom and i later learned it was the wrong tuner and the string tree was too blame. sometimes i just don't pay attention to the obvious;)it turned out that there are 3 short tuners and 3 long ones. the long ones go on the top 3 strings, the short ones the bottom 3 strings, get that because i had them on incorrectly. and even worse, i was using the string tree which is the part that holds down the 2 bottom strings. the string tree(google guitar string tree and you'll see one) was actually making the strings not stay in tune with the locking tuners. i know silly but i was not paying attention.the reason you use the short tuners for the bottom is so the guitar will stay in tune! the string trees get in the way and when you whammy the strings go out of tune. please take a note of that.overall a good product.

Review: these locking tuners are perfect for any strat or tele. i have an american strat and an american tele that both came with fairly decent non-locking tuners. i also have a carvin and two paul reed smith guitars that came with locking tuners...they are certainly worth having. fenders (at least american-made ones) are very easy to swap out tuners for these...the holes are already there, there's no need to drill holes for screws, everything is so easy you have to do it yourself. i've swapped out the tuners and have never looked back...the only question is what to do with the non-locking fender tuners i have now!

Review: i never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my american standard strat. what interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that. but i have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before. these are easy to install and simple to use. all you need is a 10mm socket and your are set. as others have pointed out, these are staggered so there are 3 long ones and 3 short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way. it only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove. i've read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but i don't even notice the difference. they work just like genuine fender parts would be expected.

Review: i replaced the original indiana guitar tuners with the fender locking tuners, and what a difference!!! i had to drill some holes in my headstock, but that was accomplished by tightening the new tuners on and leaving an indentation from the feet after removing them prior to drilling. then it was a simple matter to drill new holes and mount them. the locking mechanism is great! it acts like a vice in a woodshop project. and all i need to do is put on new strings and lock them down, tune them, use the tremolo bar a few times to stretch the strings, retune a couple more times, and they just don't go out of tune anymore, regardless of how many times i bend the strings. these are highly recommended for anybody who is tired of going out of tune.

Review: summaryif you aren't using locking tuners, you're wasting time when you restring. they are just faster and easier. overall, this is a really nice convenience upgrade on guitars and it's not very expensive to do. fender uses these on the american deluxe, and once i got one, i had to have these on the rest of my stratocasters. because they save time restringing, you are more inclined to restring frequently, which means you sound better. (fresh strings can do a lot for your sound!)i've put these on several guitars i have, and always appreciate them when changing strings. at instalation be aware these are staggered height tuners so be sure to put them in the correct holes (see below). these are drop in replacement tuners for most modern mia and mim fender stratocasters and telecasters that use a shaller style tuner. fender makes these relatively cheap now in chrome, although i wish they would make them affordable and available in a gold finish. i've seen also seen nickel and black, and they make gold but hard to find and rather expensive (something like $120 a set).function/purposei think people believe these somehow give you more stable tuning or something but that is actually not their purpose. proper use of a traditional non-locking tuner is just as stable. some folks don't actually understand how to properly use traditional tuners and they don't get stable tuning as a result because they use too few or too many wraps and don't string it correctly. for those folks, these will elimiate the resulting \"pings\" and such. but their intended purpose is to speed string changes. i believe that some folks confuse locking tuners with a locking nut in that respect. a locking nut quite definitely makes for more stable tuning, and that's why you always find them with floyd rose tremolos which are made for dive bombing. but locking tuners are not really for that purpose.fit and installationregarding fit, these have 2 little pins on the backside. if you are considering a replacement, make sure you get tuners that are the right size and configuration for your guitar so you don't have to drill the back of the neck, the tuner bores in the headstock, or use inserts. if you want to use these but don't have the little alignment holes, stewart macdonald makes a small drilling jig for drilling those holes. it's expensive (about $40) but not as expensive as messing up your neck or breaking the tuners when you tighten them down on ill fitting mounts. it is nearly impossible to drill those alignment pin holes correctly without a jig, and even with the jig, easy to be slightly off. these fit most newer fender stratocasters and tele's, both american and mim and will be a drop in replacement with no muss and no fuss in most of those cases.pull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change. if you have a squier or a knockoff you may want to measure the headstock bore and remove a tuner to look at the back mount. maybe buy and inspect, with the knowledge you might have to return them. there is usually an exact fit drop in replacement locking tuner that can replace your standard tuner so if this isn't it, look for one in the same brand as what is on your guitar now. be aware different tuners also have slightly different holes bored for the main peg hole.typical neck bores for tuners (by brand) are shown on the warmoth site at [...]these are the holes that warmoth uses on custom necks when fitting tuners of various brands:- for fender/shaller tuners, its a two step bore, with the main portion being 25/64\" and the rest at 11/32\".- vintage style tuners use 11/32\"- gotoh and grover use a two step 13/32\" to 11/32\"- sperzel uses 25/64\"- planet waves uses 13/32\"of course, if you are mechnically inclined, have the tools, and don't mind potentially drilling additional holes in your neck, you can almost fit any tuner you want on any guitar. sometimes that means using inserts or bushings, or drilling a hole for a tiny backmount screw, or for alignment pins in different locations...but the best answer is to use a tuner that is a drop-in replacement.when installing, be sure to look at the height of the pegs on your old and these new tuners. these are not all the same length -- they have staggered heights - 3 long and 3 shorter. (i think i have also seen some sets that are 4/2 but these are 3/3.) put the long ones in the e-a-d string holes, and the shorter ones in the g-b-highe holes.

Review: we use these at our church to light up stands for performing music or doing readings during worship.i appreciate the adjustable antennae so that the lights can be directed to specific areas. the light is bright enough to be able to read even if the room is otherwise in darkness. i do wish they had one more led in the heads, though - with two standard 8-1/2 x 11 pages on the music stand, the outer edges cannot be lit directly (though there is enough bleed over light to see it, it's not as bright as it could be). just another 20% output would make these 5 stars perfect.construction-wise, they're slightly fragile - clearly not made for industrial or heavy duty use - but for standard usage, they will hold up just fine and should last for years.we love them - we have 7 or 8 at the church that we use. they're especially wonderful because they're battery operated. with all the cords we already have from microphones, it's wonderful not to have an equal number of extra power cords running a bunch of electric lights. there's an extra environmental cost with using the batteries versus plugging them in, but the handiness, adaptability, and lack of extra cords make it worth it.definitely recommend these to anyone, and also recommend the manufacturer add another 20% or so lumens.

Review: this clamp on pair of miniature lamps does an excellent job of illuminating music, set lists and notes. the manufacturer claims 12 lumens of light, which is roughly equivalent to a 1 watt bulb, but the lens and the way the light is diffused make them seem much brighter. since the design keeps the light somewhat directional they are relatively discreet and will not interfere with others on the stage, in the studio or in the audience.the three batteries will last 28 hours of continuous use according to the spec sheet, and that is in the ballpark of the use time i am getting between battery changes.what i love is the dual heads, each on a gooseneck that is over a foot long. the length gives you a lot of flexibility [no pun intended] for placing the lights exactly where you want them. the goosenecks easily bend and stay in whatever position you bend them to. the clamp is perfect for most stands and has a layer of padding to prevent marring surfaces. the manufacturer claims that this light can be used free standing. frankly that is a stretch and i would recommend a light designed with a larger base if that is what you are really looking for. this one does work beautifully clamped to music stands, and the illumination will cover both pages of a chart.

Review: my wife got this for me as i tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions. this is the neatest little light i have ever seen. it takes 3 aaa batteries (included- but i did not find them until i was tossing the package out). and has 2 nice leds. the lights are bright enough for my 40 something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music. the clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand. battery life so far has been at least 8 hours (actually probably 12 hours as my daughter has been using the light also). i love the ease at which the lights are adjustable. a real needed item is you play in darker rooms.

Review: the behringer acx-450 is a good looking, great sounding amp in a small package, but should be used at low to medium volume. at higher volumes one has to take care with the equalizer to reduce bass and midrange, and also use the anti-feedback button, to avoid a \"muddy\" sound from too much (distorted?) bass. this not an amp to play loudly, but rather for low-to-mid volume accompaniment in a smaller venue.as to the sound effects, it is great with 16 effects covering reverb, chorus, delay/echo and many combinations. i especially like that you can have all the effects with totally different settings on either channel. also nice to have a separate xlr microphone input on channel 2.the cd/mp3 input is good for backgrounds (or maybe drum machine) when playing, or music during breaks, although one needs a cable with rca plugs to connect it. lack of a headphone jack is a drawback, but is balanced by all the good things this little amp offers.overall, a great sounding and very flexible amp for a low price, if you don't plan to crank it up too much!

Review: i have been using the behringer acx450 for six months now. i was impressed early, and still am very satisfied with the performance. it is a straight forward 2 channel acoustic amp with some modest effects. one would have to be filling a large venue to need more than this quality amp can provide. i'm running preamps from gibson j45 and a taylor 114 ce and they both sound amazing and i don't even know what to do with the rest of the gain. the music from these instruments is clear, bright, deep and the sound is a great reproduction of the instruments themselves. behringer's mission statement is to provide quality amplification to musicians at a reasonable price. i say, \"mission accomplished\". amazon was seamless to work with and with free fast shipping the whole experience has been great. man, how did we get by before things were so cool and easy. push a couple of buttons and magic appears at your doorstep.

Review: great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless. unless you have a mixer, you can only use one instrument and one microphone with this. really puts out the sound though, and i guess that's what you get an amp for! i used it in a basketball gym and only had to turn the gain up to 2-3 to fill the place. very nice effects on both channels.

Review: this amp sounds great, looks great, works great and is a breath of fresh air from &#34;modelling&#34; amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through. this behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five &#34;flavor&#34; settings in each. they are all on one dial and there is no pushing, pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you've switched gears. here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty. there is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar. the foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar, microphone for singing, drum machine. the eq sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you'd have to be right up on them to see how they are set. i've had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned--it's velcroed on there just fine. the cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather-like material. plenty loud.

Review: i bought the mini tone master as a practice amp for my dean evo electric guitar, and love it -- but there are a few things you should know before a possible purchase:1. when they say \"mini,\" they mean it. it's a tiny little thing about the size of a hardcover book (or smaller), and about as thick (2\" thick or so).2. it also runs off a 9v battery, though if you have a dc9v adapter, there's a plug for it. it also has a 1/4 jack for standard headphones or earbuds as well.3. it's loud. even when at low volume its tones will fill a room. this is a major plus for such a tiny, inexpensive amp.controls on the amp are great; it has a gain/distortion knob that is almost as good as having an overdrive or gain effects pedal hooked up to a full-size amp. it's strong enough to where if you're playing small gigs such as coffeehouses or hole-in-the wall small bars, you won't need to lug along your 10w (or larger) amp with you, though that may depend on the tone your guitar puts out to begin with. still, this is an awesome deal; i paid about $30 here on amazon for it, so if you need a practice amp but don't want to spend a ton of cash, snatch up one of these little bad boys. you won't be sorry.

Review: i expected this to come with a dc adapter. nowhere is it mentioned there wouldn't be any or i could have ordered one. the product is good, surprisingly loud. the bass is too much for the body and the battery cover sort of rattles (once the battery popped out by itself when i played a low E) but that's no issue. i have only used it with a 9v battery so far and noticed a continuous noise on a high gain. i hope that doesn't happen with an adapter. it's a nice little amp, good for carrying around. if you have long fingers, you can sort of hold it between your outstretched thumb and middle finger along it's height - it's that small! a guitar strap, a backpack and a 5ft cable and you could easily walk around the house playing it. the distortion it gives is good. not good for palm muting. this is nice for practising randy rhoads, the doors -type of rock where not many effects are used.also remember the dc adapter has a polarity outer ring + and inner -. many adapters come with the reverse of this polarity so make sure you check that before plugging in one. it's easy to change the polarity, open the box of the adapter and exchange (needs soldering, obv) the red and the black wire places!

Review: i have a small apartment in a small but densely populated apartment complex - space and noise is an issue. as a beginning guitarist, i contemplated a small amp but decided on the mini tone master (because in my apartment, the smaller the better). also, i had no need for ample volume or a variety of controls being at the level that i am... i just wanted something no-frills that was small, compact with enough quality sound to help me as i practice. the mini tone master delivers well.i was pretty surprised at the range of sounds the little guy can produce (from distortion grungy to a softer bluesy tone). it does not come with a power adapter but we already have on in the apartments and works well with that or with a battery. battery life is also pretty good. i've had the same battery in there for several months already, playing several times a week and sometimes leaving it on accidentally for a day or two and no signs of battery drain so far.it is a little frustrating sometimes, as another reviewer mentioned, to remove the distortion but with enough fiddling, i found a setting that was acceptable to my ears.while i didn't need volume, this little guy can be loud! no weakness there.i also plugged an acoustic-electric classical guitar into the mini tone master and it also worked surprisingly well.

Review: overall dimensions 6 3/4\" x 6 1/2\" x 2 1/4\". very nice travel size. sound is about what you would expect. it is basically a toy. if you use more than 2 (of 10 max) gain, it sounds awful. i turn guitar volume to max and adjust volume on the amp to desired level. tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies. i am using it with a fender starcaster when i travel for work (hotel friendly). i think it's over priced but i think it looks good and it seems durable.

Review: in the reviews for this item, there seems to be a lot of debate over what the fender mini tone master is and how we should evaluate it. is it a toy, or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier? do we review it compared only to other review , and it seems to be working fine. (phew!) it should also be noted that this amp is powered either by a 9v battery or a 9v dc adapter (a boss pedal supply adapter will work, for example). while the battery option is obviously nice for portability, the red \"on\" light seemed noticeably dimmer with 9v's, and i can't say how long the battery will last. if you plan to have it in one place most of the time, the adapter is the preferred way to go.sound - the concept of this amp is pretty ridiculous if you think about it - a one watt output with twin 2\" speakers. given that each speaker is smaller than the \"tweeter\" on a large stereo speaker, you won't be surprised at all to hear that there's virtually no bass in the sound. it sounds like a poor 10w solid state amp, only shrunk down to a few inches. at the same time, that's kind of a remarkable feat for a miniature amplifier, and it puts out a fair amount of sound. i opted for the mini tone master over some other options because it actually has a fair range of tones. low Gain/High volume produces pretty good clean tones, and with humbuckers and the gain turned up, it can get a bit raunchy. unfortunately, the tone control either does nothing, or behaves completely irrationally. i haven't figured out which yet. i had it at \"5\" most of the time, but it didn't seem to cut much treble as i turned it up. actually, it got the brightest around \"7\ and then almost became more muffled beyond that. but again, for a $40 mini amp, my expectations were not that much to begin with. i do like the four knobs, and the decision to make the power knob the same size as the other knobs was a subtle touch that prevents the cheaper feel of an on-off flat toy switch.i expected the speaker to overdrive/break up if you pushed it too hard, and not in a \"tube-like\" manner. that wasn't necessarily the case, but there are other problems. something internally rattles after the volume goes above \"4\ and it's not the speaker being overpowered. this is a common issue with cheap amps, and i might even pop it open to see what is rattling around. and the sound quality isn't objectively \"good\" by any means, but it is good enough to play amplified electric guitar and to hear the basic characteristics of your instrument and playing style.alternatives - the primary reason i rated this 4 instead of 5 really isn't any of the issues above (i am happy with the amp), but it's limited usefulness compared to the many alternatives for home/quiet practicing. my favorite of these, by far, are the vox amplugs, which are headphone jacks stylized after different famous amplifiers. the sound quality those things pump into your headphones is of far greater quality (and volume/fullness) than anything this mini amp could do. also, they are offered at $40 or $50, so it's simply a better value. another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software. while sound quality and volume are often a problem with smartphone apps, the possibilities for effects, modeling, and recording are endless.if you think about recent improvements in small size bluetooth speakers, you realize that the sound quality on a device of this size could be far better than what the mini tone master offers. at the same time, those speakers can cost up to $200, and premium sound quality was never the point of this amp. your opinion of it will depend on your expectations, but if you don't take it too seriously, it's a cool little device. and, in my book, anything that allows you to practice more guitar than you would otherwise is nothing to laugh at.

Review: so, these ended up being the wrong taper for my guitar, but that was my own fault due to some incorrect advice. nonetheless, i put a couple in just to compare them to my old, plastic pins. what a difference! unquestionably, the sound board was far more sensitive. sustain was much better and i got a richer tone, as opposed to the brighter tone some users reported. i should say, however, what i got was definitely the true, ebony wood pins with the inlay. i can't speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors. while these won't work due to size, i'll definitely be making the switch from plastic to ebony when i find the right size.

Review: this sam sp01 can be easily modded for use with the oktava mk319. i found instructions through a google search. the metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed. instead of hammering it out, i used two screwdrivers to pry it out. that leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use. using my dremel tool, i was able to enlarge the hole just a bit. as a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove. you must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible. then your oktava will fit just fine. this mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting. i'll post up a picture later.i found the screw-on connector to not be that high quality. it wanted to cross thread as i putting it on my mic stand. so i wouldn't want to be taking it off and putting it back on frequently. that's my only complaint about it.

Review: i don't think i can say enough good things about the samson sp01 shockmount. long story short i was trying to get a podcast going from scratch about three months ago. i did some research and discovered that a shockmount is necessary to keep any noise from anything securing the mic from being picked up by the mic while recording. a shockmount is an absolute must, especially when looking at using a tabletop mic stand where the table will also be used as a work surface.the build quality is fantastic. i just recently purchased my third shockmount for an additional mic to be used on the podcast.what i've grown to appreciate so much is that it seems to fit just about any condenser microphone i can get my hands on. if you are considering buying this for your own condenser mic, make absolutely sure that your mic has threads on the bottom to be screwed into some type of stand or shockmount. nearly all do, but some companies like blue (snowball, snowflake, etc.) are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts. i have used the mxl 007.usb with this shockmount as well as the at2020 usb and xlr version. the mxl fit like a glove, perfect. the at2020, once threaded in, seemed just a bit loose, so i added a couple foam bumpers around the base to act as a washer. it made a tight fit and further insulated it from any sound interference from any movement.in short, i haven't found a better shockmount for condenser mics. the attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand. fantastic. buy two of these!! :) thanks samson, now just make better mics!

Review: i recently bought an audio technica 2020 and was looking for a shockmount for it, i bought the one that audio technica makes and i was not satisfied with the quality, so i returned it and came across the samson sp01. my first thought was that it looked just like the shockmount i have for my neumann tlm 103. i immediately purchased it after seeing that people were using it with the at 2020. as soon as it arrived i put my at 2020 in it and it looked stunning, after i mounted it on my on-desk mic stand i bumped the table a few times to see how it worked. in short it works great, the sp01 isolates the mic extremely well. i also tested the shockmount with my studio projects c1 and rode k2 (both very heavy mics) and it works great. one word of advice it seems that some people are having problems hooking this shockmount to their mic stand ( which i find extremely amusing). like most shockmounts the samson sp01 has an adapter that is too small for most us mic stands already in the mount ( the part where the shockmount connects to the mic stand). this is easy to remove!! all you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it!! once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand.

Review: not a lot to say, works great as a shockmount!i think the best part might be that it also works with behringer c-1s. those are great mics for what they cost, but the clips they come with break easily and replacements are hard to find. that makes this shockmount a great option for people in that boat as well. hooray!

Review: i picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store. who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right? the price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well. the microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate. it gets you in the ballpark, but just barely. strike a note once, and it's sharp. play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune. i think the korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better.

Review: i've been swapping back and forth between evans and remo for a while, but after really liking the emad kick head i decided to lean more toward evans just for consistency in my setup.i consulted with an online forum to find which would be the closest 'compatible' drumhead to what i really liked from remo on the evans line, and i was led to the g2 series. (from remo's emperor series-- both being 2 plies of 7mm free floating film)honestly, i think i'm going to stick with evans from now on though!i ordered my pack shortly after the announcement of the 'level 360' sizing, and i wanted to give them a try. my fears of getting some old stock were unfounded and the set that i got was new enough to be l360 sized.i got them on, and the tuning seemed to be pretty easy. i use a drum dial to ballpark me and start my tuning process, but it went smoothly. not sure if it was the placebo effect, but i seemed to be able to get a little more low range on my floor tom as well-- deeper but just as resonant as an 808 kick.the coating seems to hold up better on the evans heads as well-- remo tends to 'flatten out' within a few hours of play, where the evans not only lasts longer, but has a more finished feel to them.

Review: recently i was looking for some heads to put on a set of starion shells that i modified. my original plan was to use a set of attack heads on both the resonant and the batter side of these shells. that decision was based mostly on price. not completely though as i have used the attack heads for resonant heads with very good results. the attack heads that i bought though are single ply. to me that make them great candidates for resonant heads but i think a two ply head is better for a batter head. i gave the attacks a shot on both sides but i wasn't completely happy with the sound and felt a two ply head would just be the better way to go.in the past i have used remo heads for batter heads almost exclusively. i still very much like the remo pinstripe heads but decided to give these evans heads a try just to try something different. i am very happy i did! these starion shells now have a very nice sound with lots of resonance. the most noticeable difference between these g2's and the attacks is that the tuning range seems to be much wider. the attacks had a very narrow tonal range where they resonated. the g2's seem to resonate everywhere! from very loose to moderately tight they have very nice sound and resonance. i have some moon gel damping pads installed to cut down on some of the resonance but doing it this way instead of choking the drum offers a much better sound. by adding, removing, or moving the moon gel pads around i can control exactly how much resonance the drums have without having to change the heads tune.i should mention that i am still using the single ply attacks for the resonant side. with the g2's on top and the attacks on the bottom these shells sound great! also, on the bass drum i have attack no ring heads on both sides. i also have a pillow in there for damping and this bass drum sounds just amazing! so, the attacks have their place but on the batter side i am very impressed with the sound, tuning range, and ease of tuning of these g2's. if you've never tried them, give them a shot, if you have you likely already know what i'm talking about!

Review: i don't put these on every guitar but on the right guitar they are perfect. what's the right guitar? longer scales- like a strat. i would not put these on a shorter scale (22\") because it would get too flubby. if you hit the power chords hard you may also want to stear clear- these require a bit more subtlety in your attack or you will vibrate in and out of tune on the low E when you are pulling off windmills like townshend. they do allow super easy string bends for when i feel lazy or for when my fingers are torn up from playing. ymmv.

Review: these strings are beyond amazing. switching to ernie ball strings should be a matter of course when purchasing a new electric guitar, and if you do any blues playing at all, extra slinkies are for you. they bend and bend and bend, are easy on the fingers during lengthy solos, and give a great sound whether you're playing gritty or bright. i also play country and punk, and these strings let me get enough twang and beef, respectively, to play those styles as well. the best $5 you will ever spend on a guitar improvement is to put ernie ball strings on your guitar.

Review: for the price, i got a little more than expected. the sound is pretty great. the scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound. other than that your can change amount of distortion. its cheap, and maybe it doesn't have alot of fancy versatility with the settings and whatnot. but for the price this is one hell of a deal! quality item.only complaints are; its so little sometimes just accidentally moving the cable will flip it around or something. but thats expected, and not that big of a deal if you're careful. now the one issue i really have with this pedal, its cosmetic so its not worth 4-starring this review; but it did get to me. the knobs. they are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures. they are black plastic ones. they look sorta bland and not as cool, but ive noticed no functionality problems with them yet. still a great product though.

Review: since, as of right now, this is the only review of this product on amazon.com, i'll try to answer any questions you might have about the ehx pocket metal muff pedal. this pedal is the model of simplicity; a volume control, a distortion control, and a switch that changes the amount (or lack thereof) of mid-scoop. that's doesn't leave much room for tone tweaking, so \"tweakers\" beware! that being said, electro-harmonix did a commendable job of pre-setting useable treble and bass tone levels that should only require minor tweaking of your amp's eq to get it right where you want it. playing through my fender hotrod deville amp, i was immediately shocked at how good this pedal sounded. the bass was powerful and chunky, great for heavy metal palm-muting riffs; the treble had a good bite but it wasn't harsh; and all three midrange modes sounded great, depending on the application: want just a flat midrange for a punchy tone? just leave the mid-switch on the flat setting. want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good all-round metal tone? move the switch down to the low mid-scoop mode. do you want to play master of puppets by metallica? the high mid-scoop mode is calling your name. this pedal offers quite a bit of distortion, but i was amazed to find that even at the higher distortion levels, my tone remained clear and defined. it didn't turn into a plastic-y, fuzzy mess like most distortion pedals cough metal zone cough will. i will mention that this pedal isn't the best if you're looking for a more modern metal tone. you won't get a slightly fizzy, ultra-gain (think slipknot) sound out of this pedal. rather it offers a very crunchy, defined roar more characteristic of the pre-dual rectifier mesa boogie amplifiers.in conclusion, i give this pedal 5 stars because it does what its designed to do very well; this version of the metal muff line isn't designed to be highly versatile and \"tweakable\" in and of itself; get the metal muff with top boost pedal if you want a 3-band eq and a boost function. this pedal is designed to be a very simple, small box of pure classic metal tone, and that's exactly what it accomplishes.

Review: within just three seconds of using the electro-harmonix pocket metal muff pedal, i knew it was a winner. it delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultra-easy to use. although it doesn't have a tone dial, it doesn't need one. and i say that after trying it through a small tube amp (15w), a small digital amp (40w), a guitar with humbuckers, and a guitar with single-coil pickups. the closest it has to a tone dial is the scoop switch just above the on/off switch. as its name suggests, this allows one to choose how much the mid tones will be \"scooped.\" it has three settings (no scoop to maximal scoop), and all sound great. fans of sustain will love this box, for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain. the pedal is extremely small, which most would regard as a plus. i bought this after watching a professional-looking youtube demonstration of it. it more than lived up to my expectations. if i lost this box, i'd immediately order another one. i have zero regrets.

Review: hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music. this small, acoustic behringer ultracoustic at108 amplifier gives the musician/singer the needed outside feedback to get things sounding right.no one hears themselves the way they sound to others. this simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music. this is why performers in the studio wear headphones while recording and why a small acoustic amplifier is a necessary piece of gear for an acoustic guitar playing, singing song writer. the behringer ultracoustic at108 acoustic amplifier more than does the job.as the owner of eight completely acoustic guitars, i thought a lot for years about trying amplification. i probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life. much to my delight, together with a passive, inexpensive hole-mounted pick-up (the seymour duncan sa3sc woody) , an inexpensive audio- technica vocal microphone and this behringer at108, i can hear a fullness and richness that actually makes good instruments sound even better!at least as importantly, it allows me to hear myself more the way i am heard by others who will not hear me, as i do in part, from the resonations inside my skull.one of the most universal and predictably shocking experiences anyone who records their own voice is struck by is how different it sounds when recorded than it does when they are singing or speaking it. the mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathom.to hear what those listening hear, you have to arrange things so as to hear the sound coming to you, not FROM you. that is where an amplifier comes in handy. it aims your own sound back at you so you can hear something a lot closer to what an audience would hear.when we 'hear' ourselves without any external amplification or direct audio feedback, we are 'hearing' a combination of the sounds being processed through our ears as well as those vibrations and sounds that are created by the vibrations in our heads. the people who hear us, only hear us through their ears. the two experiences are not the same.to discover how we really sound to others, we can go about it two ways. first, we can go ahead and record ourselves then listen and be astounded at how different we sound from how we thought we were sounding while recording, or we can put our practice through electronics - either through an external amplifier or through headphones, so that we can hear ourselves more closely to the way we will be heard by others.as an acoustic guitar player, i recently invested in a small, specifically acoustic amplifier, the behringer ultracoustic at108, and have found the results to be simply astounding as i can now, for the first time, practice my songs until they sound the way i would like them to sound to others before recording them.for a small amplifier that successfully replicates, electronically, the deep richness of an old tube acoustic amplifier, this behringer at108 provides amply volume for both the instrument and separate input voice, along with a three section equalizer, to provide the self-accompanying guitarist with the sound of what s/he really sound like to others. it can, initially, be a rather shocking experience!technically, this at108 is at the low end of the famous behringer line. although the company is based in germany, this box is built in china to their specifications. solidly built and encased in a brown vinyl wrapping, it sports:- 15 watts of power amp output,- an 8\" dual-cone full-range loudspeaker with 4 ohm impedance and a powerrating of 20 watts,- inputs for an instrument (1/4\" ts mono connector,) a microphone ( balancedxlr) and for cds (1/4\" trs stereo connector,)- a headphone output connector ( 1/4\" trs stereo connector, and- three (low, mid and high Range) frequency controllers.the unit measures approximately 13 x 14 x 7 inches, weighs just over 11 pounds and is easily portable. it comes delivered with 13 feet of instrument ready plug-in cabling.finally, to answer a question i had that caused me to hesitate for years before buying a small acoustic amp, it does not make an acoustic guitar sound, in any way, like an electric guitar. the sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic. the natural tones are enhanced, not rendered tinny or 'electrified.'it is at home in a room when you are alone practicing or on a stage in a small venue. the 15 amps pack a wallop and it can blast pretty loudly for its petite and easily portable configuration.at a current on line retail of somewhere between $75 - $95, an entire enhanced world of acoustic playing, practicing and listening is now open to me. the behringer at108 just might turn out to be one of the smartest investments i have ever made on behalf of my acoustic guitar playing, singing and recording.

Review: i have played, listened to, and used audio amps for over 4 decades, and while i haven't owned every name brand amp on the planet, i do know my way around them well enough to spot a good deal when i see one. this is a nice little practice amp for electrified acoustic guitar, with an input for a mic (xlr - no phantom power) and a cd player or other audio source. it also has a headphone output (1/4 inch). it has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs.i got this originally for my mother, who used to sing in an andrews sisters-type group back in the day. she still loves to sing, and wanted a small amp and mic to practice and do the occasional small jam. she hasn't had the opportunity to do that yet, but i have tested the amp and put it through its paces. i think it will work fine for the kind of thing she has in mind. the lack of reverb or processing for the mic is a bit of a drawback, but considering what i paid for it, i can't complain.Now, this is not a gigging amp, at least not in my opinion (your mileage may vary). it is small, solid state, with an 8 inch speaker, and 15 watts of power (i haven't measured the exact output, so i'm taking behringer's word on that). i like behringer, and they can turn out some pretty good gear, within its limits.i like the sound of the amp with my carvin acoustic guitar with a fishman preamp. it is an inexpensive practice amp, so i don't expect the same kind of quality i would from a more serious combo amp. the 8 inch speaker is obviously not going to give the kind of sound quality as a good 12 inch, no matter what. the question is, does this amp provide the sonic quality and flexibility needed to allow serious practice work, composition, or just moderate entertainment value? for me, that answer is a clear \"yes.\"however, this is an inexpensive practice amp, and if you approach it with that attitude, i think you will find it a nice little amp. don't plan on using it for your next tour with manhattan transfer, seal, or celine dion.

Review: s i thought why not. it is actually a good little practice amp. i'm still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood. it gives me the portability i needed to move about my house. i was using a mixer that's hooked to one of my pcs and using that sound card for sound. that works great, but sometimes i don't want to be tied down to the pc. i use the pc arrangement for recording and the amp for private relaxing guitar playing wherever i want to have it. i recommend this little amp wholeheartedly. just be mindful that it isn't a $500 marshall amp, but it does well in a pinch.

Review: i just can't believe how loud this little baby is. i also have a 180watts behringer keyboard amp (4 inputs, with lot of fx) but it's a littl heavy to move around.this little amp does everything i need for small gathering. i tried everything as soon as i received it:1) guitar (classic), mandolin, acoustic guitar all sound the way they normally sound in this ampactually, the classical guitar sounds much better and this encourage me to play more thru this amp.2) the microphone, although no reverb or echo, is good enough for singing, sounds as the true voice of the singer3) the mp3 input is 1/4\ which i prefer over the little 1/8\ volume must be controlled by the mp3 player itself4) guitar and mic have separate volume control (we really need it).in summary, it's ready to be used right out of the box.it only weights 15 lbs so moving around is really easy.

Review: received promptly and tested out with acoustic/electric guitar. the sound is much better than expected and the volume is loud enough for small room performances. the treble needs a little boost but with the three channel adjustments it can be made to sound fine. the small amp is just what i was looking for and the second channel for a mike is a big bonus, i haven't tried it yet since i can only play one instrument at a time but with an adapter for a 1/4 inch rca plug it could also be used to amplify two instruments at the same time.

Review: this is a must have pedal for any rock player, tight compressed distortion sound , you could play with the eq to get the sound your looking for, it goes from an overdrive sound to a really heavy distortion, it's build to last forever, the sustain is fantastic and the top boost give you another range of possibility's.the only downside is the battery, get the power adapter , batteries wont last more than 2 or 3 days and you have to unscrew the back to replace it.overall, i'm really happy with this pedal.

Review: i bought this pedal years ago, and like most guitarists who buy new gear, i fell victim to confirmation bias regarding the reviews i gave to my musician friends. upfront, the pedal sounds great. in the store, if you demo this pedal, you'll quickly be able to zero in on whatever distortion you prefer... but over time, you'll get very frustrated with the actual tone of the distortion itself. turn any of the knobs past 12, and you'll get some undesirable nasal/hissy/tinny frequencies that require compression, noise gating, and eq to tame. the &#34;top boost&#34; does provide what it advertises, but if the pedal itself is already dimebagged and you engage the top boost... it just sounds weird and unmusical.electro harmonix is a great pedal manufacturer, but i think they overstepped their bounds with this one. where is this pedal now in my collection? sold for cash. after deciding to bite the silver bullet and purchase a boss me-70 multi-effects to simplify my gigging setup, i figured as nice as it is to have an analog distortion like the metal muff, it would never compete with the digital distortion onboard the me-70... boy was i wrong. after getting the me-70, i did an a/b test and the me-70 took home the gold easily. this came at no surprise... considering both boss and mxr are respected manufacturers when it comes to distortion sounds.what would i recommend you purchase? that depends. if you're in a metal band, and you're recording an ep, no pedal in my opinion comes close to fully-cranked tube-amp distortion. however, if your amp doesn't have a good distortion channel or capability, then a more conservative (and affordable) boss ds-1 for a more musical metal tone. the reality is, most manufacturers have great distortion pedals, so it really depends on your subjective standards for tone... since no two distortions sound the same. personally, i recommend the mxr fullbore metal... the pedal i wish i had bought instead of the metal muff. the noise gate and mid scooper switches are far better pedal accessories than a top boost. the fullbore also has a mid frequency shaping knob... which can dramatically shape the overall sound.

Review: dang that's metal. were the first words i said when plugging this thing in to the line. with a wide range of sound and versatility with just one pedal and two buttons is awesome. the only issue was with some manufacturing detail. the input and out put jacks are screwed up and nearly broke my cables when trying to set it up for the first time. the buttons were way to stiff and made a horrid crunch the first time i used it and after talking to amazon it turns out that just seems to be how it is. be sides that its metal, nothing more nothing less. razor sharp high ends or some butt draggin muddy slop of sound either way your covered with this pedal.

Review: this is a pretty awesome pedal, especially if you're going for more of an 80's or 90's metal sound that's more chunky and defined than fizzy. think earlier mesa models, like the famous mark iii c+ that was used by metallica on the master of puppets album. of course no pedal can perfectly replicate that sound, but the metal muff does a pretty amazing impression.some of the best aspects of the metal muff include:1. great clarity and definition, even on higher gain settings. seriously, most high gain pedals cause you to lose a lot of definition in your playing, but the metal muff doesn't do that. so especially for the lead guitarist, this should be a major selling point.2. wide range to the tone controls. with some pedals it's really hard to hear a difference when you adjust the tone controls, but not so with the metal muff. you can easily dial in the sound you're after, or maybe even find a new sound you like even better.3. the quality of construction is absolutely superb. everything about the pedal is rugged and durable. i'd feel totally comfortable gigging without a backup.on a different note, i've only used this pedal with my fender hotrod tube amp, and it sounds great. however, i prefer the rocktron zombie pedal to the metal muff(see my review of the zombie for more info on that). however, the rocktron zombie doesn't sound good through solid state amps. i mention this because if you're using a tube amp, i honestly feel that the zombie is a better option. but if you're playing through a solid state amp, the i've read that the metal muff still shines. just something to consider.to conclude, this pedal is awesome if you're looking for a pedal to give an all-round good, straight-up metal sound. sure, it's a bit of a one-trick pony, but it's a pretty good trick. if you're looking for an ultra high-gain distortion monster then look else where, but otherwise i recommend giving the metal muff a look.

Review: hey, it's a fun little toy, but i've seen this thing going in most places for an even $100 which is ridiculous. i was lucky enough to get it on amazon for $80. once you get over the novelty of it it will sit on top of your amp to collect dust. i've made some cool effects and written a many a great riff with this but it's not one of those tools you'll use every song... unless you're so amazing you can make it work every song! learning how to use it properly and finding the nuances of making it work is half the fun, but once you get it, and you're over it, you wonder why you wasted $100 on something that shouldn't have cost more than $50. it's essentially a 9v battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light. this was one of those impulse buys that grabbed a hold of me when i had nothing better to use my money on.

Review: i first became aware of the ebow way back in the 80's when the song &#34;big country&#34; by the band big country came out. they used it to simulate bagpipes and i always loved that sound. i finally purchased an ebow about a year ago. i'm a songwriter and record my own demos at home. i also perform live in a cover band. i don't use the ebow very often but when i do, it really adds to the performance. i recorded an ebow track for an original song in a passage where there was only acoustic guitar and it added another dimension to the overall sound and made my recording sound more professional. for live playing it can be a little tricky because sometimes it takes a few seconds to get the strings to start vibrating. with practice, i think this could improve. i play the solo on stp's &#34;sour girl&#34; and it sounds very much like the original recording. people in the audience tend to take notice during that solo and i get questions about how it works. i have not had good luck with arpeggios but again, practice could improve this.the octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound. battery life is exceptional. i have only had to replace the battery once. overall, i think this is a great product. i wish it had been a bit less expensive but if i lost it, i'd buy another one.

Review: the ebow is a crazy concept. it's fun to use and also very challenging. it comes with a book that had many variations on how to use it, which was nice. comes with a velvet pouch and dvd. it's a little pricey now i assume from supply and demand but if you've got the extra cash and play every day, pick this up. also, i played in a band and we did miserlou and the other guitar player played the trumpet part with an ebow. i don't know how he did it or what setting his amp was on, but it sound like there was a trumpet in the room. he clearly, was good with an ebow. goes to show how diverse they are.

Review: i decided to try these open metal finger picks when i could no longer find propicks, which i really like. propick open metal pick users will probably think that these look very familiar. compared with the propicks these are manufacturer from a heavier, stiffer metal. they offer the user the advantage over conventional plastic and metal finger picks that you can actually feel the string with the fleshy part of your finger. i find these (and the propicks, for that matter) much more natural than conventional picks. these actually have some advantages over the old propicks: (1) you get three finger picks, rather than two; and (2) because the metal is a heavy gauge, they seem to be less likely to bend during playing and fall off your fingers. it would be nice to see these packaged in a little plastic container so that they're protected in the guitar case; however, they are so heavy duty that they can probably survive quite well free-ranging around in the case. highly recommended for fingerpicking on acoustic guitar and resonator guitar.

Review: i've had behringer mikes before, and currently have a couple of xm2000s, which are very reliable and comparable to shure sm 58s. i saw this three pack of 1800s for $40 in a hard case and couldn't believe it. i hooked them up right beside the 2000s, and while there is a little difference, it's not much. the 1800 has a little more high end, but it's easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass. the presence is also boosted a little on the 1800, meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback.for now, i'm using the matched 1800s as the main mikes for our vocalists, and keeping the older 2000s as backups.i bought the 3 of these for less than the price of one sm 58. although the shure (and the b 2000) is better, the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for. i can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup.a wise choice for the budget conscious.

Review: the 3-pack is a fantastic deal. i've been around mics under $100 for 30 years, and when compared to other mics in the $50-$100 range, they are as good or better! good lows and clean highs without any hiss. absolutely NO whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp. don't miss out on this great deal.

Review: surprised really. for the price i dont think i could have done better. nice case, come with stand adapters, and make me sound pretty good and i cant really sing. dropped one a few times and its still working. good feel/weight. on /off switches on each. i record to daw and the recordings sound fine. i usually run everything through a bbe so that might be part of why i am pleased with them but i do recocmmend these for mics in this price range.

Review: these don't sound all that great on stage or at rehearsal with the my other sm58s and beta 58s in a band situation, but that actually wasn't the purpose of these microphones... the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system, at which they excel. the facility we use these at, the mics have a habit of walking away, or escaping maybe... stolen? perhaps. they sound great through the ceiling, they have on/off switches, and they're cheap, we can just buy another box of 3 in a few months when we're down to 1 again. seems like they'll last forever, too bad they keep wandering off on us.

Review: i love these microphones, i really do. i also believe that it was really cool they threw in the microphone holders and the case is quite nice. the 2 things i did not like was 1, the microphone has to be really close to your mouth to get a good sound out of it, otherwise it does not sound as crisp. 2, although it was nice of them to include the microphone holders, the items they work with are very limited so make sure that they match up with a microphone stand you want to buy or else it won't screw in. it is good to be aware the wire that connects to this microphone is an xlr female, so buy the correct wire when connecting to an amp/speaker. for the price i really do recommend these, as long as your fine with having to put the microphone centered,and close to your mouth. overall a great product.

Review: i bought these for supplemental mics for a podcast, verbal audio recordings. the sound quality is very good from these mics, in fact its hard to distinguish the difference on non-pro mixers from other higher end mics. they feel good in your hand, nice build quality, and if you put a windscreen on them there is very little pop. sensitivity is good, and i'm very pleased by this purchase. i'd definitely recommend these for any kind of audio recording, they may even be a good option for instrument recording given the lower price tag. note: once you put the pop screens on, they no longer fit into the carry case. you have to remove the wind screens or modify the cushioning inside the case.

Review: okay well i lied in subject line, bad singers sound bad whatever mic you put in their hand. i can say that with authority since i run kj shows 6 nights a week and have for the last 20+ years, so i know good singers when i hear them. and they will ask if i have a shure sm58, to which i reply hell no, you think i'm going to put a 58 in the hands of a careless drunk? the more you drink the better you sound or so some of my patrons believe. some also drop the mic or worse, spike the mic. i'd rather lose one of these behringers than a 58. or a wireless 58. sound wise these are great for their intended purpose. if you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic, this is the bargain.

Review: i own several taylor acoustics, and a few other kinds of guitars. i bought the original pack of these from a suggestion of a friend who had a few acoustics damaged by humidity (too dry). these are so easy to use, and can be &#34;recharged&#34; if you feel like $12-15 for 3 is too much every couple of months. i've successfully recharged these using distilled water about 3 times now, and they work just as great as they did new. these also come in a resealable package, so you can recharge them and then store them until you need to replace the other set in guitar case.you can tell when they've dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling. it means they need to be replaced.to recharge them, i take a large ziplock plastic container with a lid (big enough to hold 1 quart), and then pour a few cups of distilled water in the bottom. next, i take a smaller empty ziplock container (the bottom of one big enough to hold a sandwich), and float it on the water in the larger container. then place the 3 packs in the floating container (stacked on one another or on their sides) and seal the top of the larger container with a lid. it traps the humidity in the container, and the membrane on these packs is two-way, so they absorb it until they reach capacity again.

Review: i live in a dry climate, and i have to add distilled water to my humidifiers almost daily. since i can't afford to add a special room to humidify my instruments, the planet waves humidipak is the next best thing. i get anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks out of a pack. the time and effort this pack saves me to keep my humidifiers repleted with water is well worth the price. on the refillable humidifiers, you really can't forget more than a day or two to replenish the water. with the humidpak, you have a lot more security. going on a trip? you won't have to worry about your string instruments if you have these in your case.

Review: i bought this for my new 12 string guild acoustic. i use oasis humidifier for my other acoustics and am satisfied with them. the reason i tried this one is because it's necessary to spread the strings quite a bit to get the tube in between them. and with 12 strings, it really put a lot of tension on them. another difference is there is nothing to do with the planet waves. you slip the included packs (2) into the saddlebag type pouch and slide them between the strings. they should last 3-4 months & you don't do anything else. also comes with a 3rd one for the headstock. with others you have to add water and remeber to check it so they don't dry out. i also used a dampit but because it hangs from a cord, it sometimes gets caught on the wiring on an acoustic-electric! i may eventually replace my oasis humidifiers with these also.

Review: unlike those who have complained that they dry out fast, i have always gotten much longer life out of them than the product promises. what i can't tell you is how well they actually meet humidity ideals because i've never monitored the humidity in the case to see what it is and if it is on par with what the manufacturer says. i have taken it pretty much on faith that they deliver what they say and they have read some endorsements by people like bob taylor of taylor guitars that they work. bob has too good a name and no incentive that i know of to be frivolous about endorsing such a product that might not work, so, i take it that taylor had his lab people check them out thoroughly to be sure of humidipaks effectiveness before mr. taylor would give them an endorsement. that was good enough to sell me. but i didn't just buy it because bob taylor says they work--they occupy a very cool niche which i was hping someone would fill. planet waves humidipaks are for the person who is willing to spend a little extra to not to have to keep fiddling around with water, sponges, gauges and those oasis water bag and just have something that you can dispose of and replace every so often. that's what i want. sure, water is free. but it evaporates fast and it's a job to keep having to take care of. so, is it worth it to buy a disposable thing like this that you don't have to mess with? or do you want to save $15 or so by doing all that work wetting sponges and whatnot weekly? i'll gladly pay the extra few bucks not to have to worry about hydrating my guitars and cases but once avery 6 months.none of my guitars have shown any signs of humidity issues and i have lived in new york city and virginia beach in the years since i've been using the planet waves humidipaks. one accolade that i will give planet waves is that they did recall the product a few years back and promised replacements when the new model which resolved a potential leakage problem was released. that re-release seemed to drag on for a while and when i contacted planet waves to gripe, they sent me a check for the \"list\" price of all the units i had returned to them. well the list price was three times the retail price at the time and that was a bit of a minor windfall at the time for me which impressed the heck out of me and i used the money to buy their other humidity products in the interim to humidify my guitars. but when the humidipaks were available again they sent me replacements anyway. that was really being treated well by planet waves and i have never used anything else but humidipaks since. humidipaks give me peace of mind that my guitars are being humidified and i'm more than satisfied with how long the paks last.

Review: my bass-playing has gone on for 50 years,...and during the time i've tried lots of strings on my many bass guitars. i know from that experience how the quality and construction of strings has improved over the decades.this set of d'addario chromes is remarkable. it's a flat wound string with all the smoothness and quiet character found in that string type. in this set, i especially like the 4th string at .100&#34; dia. this set, by its design, gives a very strong and powerful signal to the amp,...and therefore makes even my schecter diamond series 4-string sound largely like the early p-bass with bottom to spare. there's a 'however'.... and this is it,....this string is not muddy sounding like many flat wounds. clean, bold, and full of smooth overtones that work well. i really like them. the price is fair, and we'll see what kind of life they exhibit, as i don't want to be spending lots of hard-to-find cash on new strings at a frequency that is aggravating.don p.

Review: well, that's overstating it a little, but several people told me i wouldn't like fw strings on my bass. i wanted to try them to get closer to an earlier electric bass sound, smoother and more mellow. i considered rws to be way too bright on my guitar. so i put these on my 1978 musicman sting-ray bass. i only have a little peavey practice amp, which may account for how bright these still sound. but i love them. i have to dial the active eq treble control all the way down, this is just a bright-sounding bass! but i wanted more of a stand-up doghouse bass sound, like early basses had. i have a low-level hofner violin bass, also with fws on it (it shipped with rws,what were they thinking???), but i loves me my musicman. and i love the sound of these strings. oddly, a smidgen of the wrap extends below the nut, but it doesn't seem to affect the sound. as soon as i get a real amp, i expect these to completely satisfy. and they will pop, but then again, this is an awesome bass, made during leo's time with mm. but if you want that real \"vintage\" sound, these are pretty damn good. lack of a good amp, and not knowing how long they'll last is why i gave them 4 stars. otherwise, 5 star all the way.

Review: maybe it's because i cut my musical teeth on motown and 60s rock, but i've always preferred the sound of flatwound strings to round wound, or even ground wound strings. it might also have something to do with the fact i play upright as well. flatwounds are easier on the fingers of both hands, and they have a natural damping that makes them sound more upright-like to my ears. it doesn't hurt that a good set of flat wounds will last practically forever, too. i use d'daddarios on all my my electric guitars and basses as i've found them to be very consistent from set to set, and the sealed plastic packaging means that i can buy a set today, put it in my case, and it's be as good as new a year later.i used to use labella flats on my fretless, and then switched to thomastik jazz flats. then a friend told me he'd switched from the thomastiks to these. he found them much more consistent in quality, and smoother as well. i'm now a convert, too.

Review: i recently picked up asquier fretlessbass. as with any guitar, the factory strings left much to be desired. with fretted basses, i'd always liked strings with a little brassiness. but round-wounds just didn't feel (or sound) right on a fretless. small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction. and round-wounds just didn't have that acoustic sound. there were quite a few choices for fretless strings, but i've always liked d'addarios on my 6-string guitars. these flat-wounds were a perfect choice. they've got plenty of bottom, but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings. the bass sounds more like a 'real' bass. and the action is now so smooth. i can use a small vibrato when i like--no longer restricted to the wide jaco-style.there are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds. but there's something about a fretless that attracts a particular sort of player--the player who wants a bit of that upright bass sound. as soon as i put these on, i felt like i was home.

Review: i used to use 009 to 032 and decided to up it a size to the 010... i like light strings for a more classical and sweeter sound. the heavier gauges such as 11's are okay too but the 012's seemed to be used a lot for the chop rhythm which i don't ascribe to. at one point i did have a set of bluegrass 012's on it but they didn't feel right for me plus i didn't like the way the 012's sat on top the nut, i was a bit worried that the nut would crack, which is what happens when the gauges are too fat for the nut slot.if you want 012's i would highly recommend you take it to a tech so he can evaluate the nut and slot it to the proper width to accommodate the 012.the reason i switched from 009 to 010 is that i was hard pressed and in need of a set and the local music shop didn't carry the 009's any longer so i went to the 010. i believe my mando was set up with 10's or 11's but i wasn't sure. i tweaked the action and the 010's are fine and i've made the adjustment.strings, ahem.... are just about all the same. they local music shop is very knowledgeable and they told me a story around namm shows and how the string booths don't really give out too much info and the origins of their products. there may be (according to the my local music shop) a few companies that actually make their own strings but the bulk of the strings out there are probably manufactured in a mass quantities at factories in prc or other offshore sources, sold in bulk and packaged by the companies. who knows? and the shop sure tried to find out but it's a dark dark secret out there at the trade shows, so nobody is talking, and making a logical assumptions from a corporate standpoint are probably not too far off the mark, i.e. strings are mass produced for market and most string companies as i said earlier are buying bulk and packaging for the consumers.what does that mean? that means i need some inside info to this bulk purchasing and i'll sell my own! the quality is probably up as much as the tooling and raw materials will allow, so why not!cheers!

Review: in my 13 years of playing the guitar i have settled on d&#8217;addario as my string of choice. when i picked up the mandolin four months ago deciding which string to buy was easy. i&#8217;m really glad i did. the tone is great, they&#8217;re durable and smooth on the fingers. even though they are smaller strings they still produce the sustain and bell-like tone that mandolinists are after. they respond great to different styles and dynamic levels. you can play sweet classical passages, roaring bluegrass and even rock. i have a high end washburn f-style and these strings coupled with wegan picks make the washburn sound spectacular! they also bring out the sound of the wood too which i appreciate. if you are in need of a smaller string that still sounds good, this is the pack to get. thanks d&#8217;addario for providing an awesome product!

Review: the strings on my new yamaha fg700s were too hard and noisy so i ordered these and what a difference in the feel! playing went from painful to pure pleasure! i did notice that the tone of the low E string was a bit dead, especially in drop d tuning so i put that one yamaha string back on and got better sounding lows. for that, i gave four stars instead of five.

Review: these d'addario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking. a couple of notes, though: (1) on the positive side, they are made in the u.s.a. of american-produced materials (unlike silk and steel strings by a famous american guitar company whose name starts with \"m,\" which are assembled south of the border); (2) on the negative side, they cost more than m-----'s silk and steel strings; (3) in general, silk and steel strings squeak more on position changes than straight steel strings, especially more than flat-wound acoustic strings; (4) the tone is very nice and mellow, sort of a cross between flat-wound steel strings and nylon strings; (5) the d'addario folk set is very easy on the fingers and therefore are ideal if you play a lot, or if you primarily play a fairly light gauge electric string and only acoustic on occasion; (6) they really work best for finger picking (whatever you do, don't use metal finger picks), and are less effective than steel strings for flat picking.

Review: i have an alvarez yari acoustic guitar that i absolutely love. but i have wanted, missed a warmer tone (the body of this guitar is slightly smaller than many and i had always assumed that i would never be able to get the tone i wanted in the low end... as compared to the bass enhancing body of a typical dreadknot style of guitar, for example...).then a friend recommended i try these strings, and, to my mind, my guitar has seen nothing short of a transformation!here is the gorgeous tone i had missed!i am now on my second set of strings, and i am hooked.one thing: i have heard that these strings aren't as durable as other strings.however, this hasn't bothered me, as tend to finger-pick and soft strum, and so, this possibility hasn't become an issue for me.and while i would make no claim that everyone would have the great experience i did, i would wholeheartedly recommend trying these strings to anyone looking for a variation in tone.the fact that it is easier on the fingers is another reason to give these a try! thumbs up!

Review: i was looking for a small, high quality monitor for use in the praise band at church. i needed to run my boss gt-100 and vocals through it on stage. this little speaker is more than loud enough for a good size stage with reasonable stage volume. it is built extremely well/very solid and sounds incredible. the volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing. i still chuckle when someone asks me to turn my guitar up and i do and all this sound comes from this little speaker sitting on the floor. there is a threaded mic stand socket on the bottom, but i place it on the floor and angle it back by putting my di box underneath it. between this and my gt-100 i have the ultimate direct guitar system, with inputs still available for a monitor feed from the main board. simply fantastic piece of equipment.

Review: one of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track. a pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs. they can be configured as a master/slave set-up with a single link cable (a 1/4 inch speaker cable), or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs, assuming five inputs per cm-30. in reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient.the low, mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ. i have run both aroland rd-300nx digital pianoandroland v-combo vr-700. the grand piano setting on the rd-300nx sounds like the real thing out of this amp, as does the b3 emulation from the v-combo.i did a direct comparison with this against amackie srm150 5.25-inch compact active pa systemand the sound of this beat it hand's down. bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency range.vocals through the channel with the xlr are adequate, but not particularly spectacular. also, there is no phantom power or ground lift features, so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances. that leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances.i use mine as a powered main, but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box. that is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you. however, once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instrument's volume and eq controls.there are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand. first, the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the cm-30 to the floor not exceed 43 inches. i agree. this may be relatively small, but it's heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high. it's easy to tip over, especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended.

Review: i play guitar and sing in relatively small places, such as cafes. i previously used a fender acoustasonic jr and i got tired of lugging it (about 50 lbs) and all of my other gig equipment around. with the cm-30 i can get it (12 lbs), mic stands, music stand, mic, and various cables and etc into a medium sized rolling duffel. that means i can haul everthing i need in one trip. a big plus.i like the sound quality i get. my guitar is an acoustic alverez with onboard preamp and my mic is a shure sm-57. the roland doesn't have a huge amount of volume, but if you're looking for something that sounds natural and is easy to transport, set up and take down, this is a good choice. (if i used it a with a passive guitar pick-up, i'd want external preamp.) think of it as as a sound booster for when you are playing in a bigger space than your living room.i'm also thinking i will use it in larger rooms as a personal monitor with my acoustasonic jr.it looks really rugged, so i'm looking forward to years of happy use.

Review: i'm frankly sick and tired of showing up for a gig and having my keyboard run through the p.a., thereby in essence causing me to forfeit all control of the instrument to the bandleader (or board op). still, i've had to concede that the amps i've been using--a roland kc150, then a kc350--had plenty of power and pop but no sonic attributes that would recommend them above the bose p.a. set-up the band uses. then, because i needed a small amp with an xlr connection for use as an emergency p.a., i picked up this relatively new item from roland, which prominently describes itself as a \"monitor\" amp (i.e. meant only for the performer's ears).was i surprised when i got this thing home and put it through some rounds with a kurzweil pc2 and sp2. it's little more than a compact brick, but it appears to have the power of my kc150 and, more importantly, in terms of \"listenability\" it sounds like its several heavens apart from the kc 150 or 350 (those ever-present roland kc amps will make any piano, including rolands, sound uninspiring if not boring during the course of a four-hour gig). this latest contender covers the entire piano range, effortlessly, smoothly, providing rich yet responsive bass where its needed and brilliant but not strident highs. perhaps some would judge the sound a trifle \"colored.\" if so, i'll take the coloration any day to the untempered sounds i've been getting from electric keyboards. the mid-range is tight and controlled, with the upper register \"growing out\" of it gradually but unmistakably. by contrast, the upper register on the heavy-duty kc amps strikes like a serpent, leaping out of the mix like home-brewed white lightning hitting the palate after it's just gotten accustomed to a vintage bordeaux.i even compared this little thing to my previous standard--the roland cube 60 that had preceded the kc150 (which has been around too long). this new one was smoother, bending to the bass notes like a gracious willow and springing to the top ones like fresh spring birch. in other words, even the roland cube sounded uneven and rough compared to this latest overachiever, which handled the tones of the scale like a single portamento, revealing no holes in any of the registers.playing any instrument or amplifier on the job can lead to a judgment radically different from the one made at home. if my instruments (i'm usually playing 2-3) have to be mixed through the p.a., fine. i won't have to listen to them. they'll be processed by this monitor, which will be facing and playing for me before it kicks out the stuff that the bandleader deems worthy of the public's ears.

Review: i use two of these as l/r channels, and my fishman soloamp as a center channel. i use a rode nt4 stereo mic, run everything through my mackie mixer, adding some reverb and delay (delay a little of the left, send to right channel, and vice versa), and it sounds fantastic (way better than with just the fishman alone). another tip: get a copy of yamaha's sound reinforcement handbook... when it comes to audio, there are so many aspects that all effect each other, so you really need a good technical understanding of it, otherwise you could randomly mess around with everything forever just to get an \"ok\" sound.

Review: i bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage. i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d-28, but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.imagine my profound disappointment.really, boss??? this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours. this thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the review s on-line. seems like it is part of the design. it's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. totally unusable, as far as i'm concerned. by the way, i tested it direct to a pa as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat).

Review: . i wasn't expecting much from this pedal, but it is quite good. is it a completely authentic acoustic sound? i'd have to say... not exactly. but it's kind of close, and it's a far cry from lowering your volume and raising your master, which still sounds distinctly electric. so far, the setting with the most convincing acoustic tones would be the jumbo setting. again, don't expect to sound completely acoustic -- it's a nice way to at least approach that sound. check out some youtube tests before buying.it's &#34;okay&#34; on my blues jr. nos, but really shines on my crate td-35, which is a brighter amp and less colored. i zero the spring verb and use the pedal's onboard reverb for best results.used it with my strat and also a humbuckered guitar with a duncan hotrod set. sounds good with both guitars -- especially neck and center positions.pedal is solid. be advised that it comes with the 9-volt from the factory, so if you use a dc power source then you'll want to remove the battery. to do so, you'll see a black knob at the base of the pedal. just unscrew it, pop the hood, and remove the battery. overally, solid pedal as you'd expect from boss.a word of warning. not sure if it's my setup, but when the ac-3 is in my effects chain (not a loop, but in front of the blues jr), i started getting really bad static sounds that sounded like the amp was malfunctioning -- burnt tube or the like. when i run it alone to my crate, i haven't experienced this. could be any number of things in my effects chain, so check if others experience this.i'm wondering if a small, cheap acoustic amp would help augment the acoustic tone with the pedal. never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp. not sure how a non-piezo pickup would affect the tone. anyone know about this?

Review: i guess the term toppy describes the sampling range, which picks up the higher notes. if you want to get the right effect, this is a good choice. for those of us, who find acoustic guitars difficult to play, this is solution. personally i have a lazy blues style and my attempts to play acoustic guitars, too often feels like i am using a manual typewriter. this product does what it says on the box, but sounds better using hum bucker pickups, or if you play a strat, it sounds very good on the middle or neck pickup. don't use the bridge pickup, as it doesn't sound too good.

Review: the boss ac-3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator. i am the only guitarist and in my playing environment (children's church) and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric. the ac3 does that job. although it has several modes, the jumbo mode seems to be most useful. played through a carefully eq'd amp, you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings. there is an audible hiss, less noticeable plugged direct into pa, noticeable plugged into a good, clean tube amp, out of control with humbuckers or solid states.the key to using this pedal is using it correctly.first and foremost: use single coils. tested with a les paul with burstbucker pro's, the hiss was overwhelming. played with an american deluxe strat with n3 noiseless pups in the 3rd position, it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channel.point two - any form of gain will create a ton of hiss.point three - tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps (tested through a frontman 212 and vox pathfinder vs an orange tiny terror and fender hrd).the ac3 is not a set it and forget it pedal. based on the volume of the amp and the room you're in, you will need to tweek the eq to find that tone. i've read that you can use an eq pedal to get the same tones, i haven't found that to be the case. if your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch, or in my case as the only guitar player, to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly, this is a great fit.-2 stars for ever present hiss, +3 for actually sounding like an acoustic when it's eq'd correctly.

Review: summaryacoustic sounds &#34;ok&#34;, but noisy in weird ways. i returned it. price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.pros- boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable- standard 9v power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs.- variety of acoustic sounds possible. (personally, i only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- while i have several boss pedals, i think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small. i prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.details:the basic concept is good. i had an ac-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. it wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. it was also just noisy in the pedal chain. adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. however, i sold that model because i didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and i wasn't happy with the sound. at the time, the ac-2's were selling for about $85 new. boss since redesigned and raised the price significantly on the ac-3.i bought the ac-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the ac-2 -- and they did, a little. but not enough to keep it. i returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. i think the ac-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.i opted for a behringer acoustic modeller instead. they make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;. the 400 has reverb on the pedal. i opted for the 300 and got it for $25. i expect the durability will be lower on the behringer than the boss as it has a plastic case. however, this is an effect i pull out just once in a while and since i can buy 4 or 5 or 6 behringers for the price of a boss....if it breaks...i'll just buy another.i also have a boss gt-100 multi-effects unit. you can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the behringer or out of the boss ac-3. the least cost effective of those choices is the ac-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.i'm not saying its a bad pedal, i'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. if they would fix the noise issues, i might have even kept it. i did opt to keep the behringer for those times i'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. this boss pedal just didn't work that well for me.

Review: as with all boss / roland products, the boss fs-6 performs as designed. i purchased it to control both my boss me 20 multi effects pedal and my fender blues jr amp. the a switch (in non latching mode) allows me to cycle through stored effects banks in my me 20 and the b switch (in latching mode) allows me engage and disengage the fat (overdrive) switch on my blues jr amp. everything works exactly as planned. the fs-6 rugged, compact (fits right into my into me 20 carrying case) and easy to use.i read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries...something to complain about. as with most guitar players i don't use batteries in my effects pedals i use an 9 volt ac/dc adapter. visual sound offers the \"one spot\" ac/dc adapter kit that has a 9 volt battery snap connector adapter. i removed the battery cover, then using a small rat tail file i carefully cut a notch in the battery cover for the snap connector to pass through. i then put rubber feet (purchased at ace hardware) on the bottom to allow the snap connector cable...battery problem solved.i also use the fs-6 as a sustain pedal for my yamaha ypg 225 portable grand piano and a control for my rc-3 loop station simultaneously. the possibilities are limited only to your imagination. it is somewhat expensive but it is a great product!! if you need a duel switch then i highly recommend purchasing the fs-6.

Review: i bought this pedal as a companion to my roland ac-33 acoustic amp. the pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy. however you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate. this is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch. the worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out. the only way i could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made. for the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that boss would put out a better product. i also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question. i would highly recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site.

Review: i use this pedal in tandem with my apc-40 and map the buttons to various controls in ableton. the foot switch opens the door to more organic sound live performances with a prepared track. the polarity switches are nice, however the momentary/latch switches are what makes this unit so compatible with my daw. some functions such as play and stop are momentary functions, other functions such as track on/off are toggle/latch functions. without a foot switch that can toggle between the two, applications are limited certain functions. i use the footswitch for a variety of applications, in a variety of songs with different arrangements. if i could hook up more than one of these to my controller, i'd have about four of them, but the one is so nice on its own.

Review: ever since i saw a vid with mark tremonti where he says that he heard a lot of musicians used jazz 3 picks, and after having tried them that he simply couldn't use an other pick.. i decided to try them out.. and i fell instantly in love with the regular jazz iii picks!i always had issues holding picks and keeping them &#34;put&#34; while i played and the jazz iii was no exception so it didn't bother me..meaning i didn't really feel like there was a problem other than me, being that problem... then i read about this new ultex thingyit looked like a jazz iii and every one seemed to like it..sooo i figured why not have a go at it... i was skeptical about this &#34;impossible to drop&#34; thing which i read..so i was dieing to feel them... well they came.. i tried them and after playing for a while i didn't even notice that i hadn't once readjusted my pick..... not ONCE ... it was like there was no pick.. i started paying closer attn and more and more i realized that this thing really is what its hyped up to be... it stays there... to me that's just freaking incredible! holy @#$@%# wow! i love this thing love it love it!

Review: i replaced a bone non-compensated saddle of my parlor sized guitar with this.this is a convenient product as the thing is already close to final thickness you need, you don't need to change the compensation much if at all, the material sands easier than bone, polishes well, and the tone is really good.A little careful sanding/polishing and the guitar was ready to play. i like the product.

Review: i had to make some adjustments on the neck of my martin d-28 and remove the bridge pickup. this left the saddle too low to the neck. i researched the \"tusq\" products and found enough people impressed to give it a try. i'm pleased to say i find more ring through the body and a better sustain. i'll do this to my other acoustics as time goes on.

Review: i bought a tusq nut and this tusq saddle for an aria acoustic which can be a nice sounding guitar. the difference is quite noticeable and good. the guitar is a modest model but it is a player with a \"better than a lot more expensive guitars\" sound. i had a bone nut that cracked which is why i tried these replacements. in my estimation the sound is clearer, brighter and louder. the price seemed high for a little chunk of \"plastic\" but the difference in sound leaves me satisfied.

Review: replaced the plastic saddle in my yamaha f335bl. had to file it to make it thinner, and filed it down to make it shorter than the old saddle, this made the action a bit lower and made it easier to play for a beginner. it did change the sound of the guitar, it sounds fuller, and the sustain is longer.

Review: having recently purchased an epiphone el-00 i went about changint the bridge pins and bridge itself from the installed plastic units to graph tech's tusq material. it is hard to emphasize just how much they have improved the tone of what was a very good instrument to begine with. the top resonates with a greater sustain due to the vibrational transfer of the tusq bridge and pins, the note to note defination went from very good to exceptional. this was one of the best modifications i have made to an instrument in many years of tweaking my instruments. i have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade...i can barely wait. i highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice.

Review: so based on the reviews from amazon, and a friend who swears by these pickups, i decided to put one into my 310 taylor.i am extremely pleased! this was my brother's guitar, and he had a mcyntire soundboard transducer installed by his local guitar shop. it sounded terrible. i tried messing with placement to get it to sound better, but it just didn't sound good, had tons of feedback, and just didn't have a good feel.i installed this pickup myself. i have installed a few pickups in a few different guitars, and this one was pretty painless.i didn't have to drill out the endpin hole, so it only took me about 20 minutes to install this bad boy.when i tested it out i was blown away. it sounded beautiful! just like my taylor, only louder!the true test was an actual live performance. i brought my baggs para acoustic d.i. and i was glad i did.i was able to adjust the eq just a tad, cut some of the mid-range a bit, and it sounded even better!i could not believe it. it literally gave me chills.if you're on the fence about this pickup, go for it! the reviews don't lie, this sounds fantastic, especially if you can eq it a bit.i did plug in without the padi, just to test it and it still sounded good. if i forgot my padi i would have no qualms about playing this straight into a system. it might be labeled as passive, but it's got the volume of an active system for sure!it's a great buy in my opinion.

Review: i have k&k pickups in other guitars. this is the first one i've bought that had the smaller transducers. it needs a preamp unlike the now discontinued pure western with the larger transducers. like other k&k pickups it sounds darned good. with a decent pa head and good speakers you can get a very natural sound with hardly any tweaking. the pickup is easy to install if you can ream out the end pin hole to accommodate the strap jack. this one comes with an ingenious diy installation jig made from, i'm not kidding, cardboard, golf tees, and double sided tape. it makes placement a snap. the best pickup is still an external mic, but for noisy situations where feedback is a problem these pickups are the answer. you can induce feedback but you can go to an adequate level for most situations. they sound much more natural than a magnetic or under saddle pickup.

Review: this pick-up sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically. it does pick up percussive noise which you don't get with under saddle pickups. it is prone to feedback in very loud situations if you don't use a sound hole cover. over all i'm please because i was able to install myself and it was simple. you do need to use an external pre-amp, but even with piezo pick-ups that is usually the norm. the directions that comes with the pickup are very thorough and the company is helpful if you have questions. the only change i had to make to my guitar was making the end pin jack bigger and that was easy too.

Review: the hercules travlite guitar stand is an average stand in my opinion. it does hold up the acoustic guitar and it is very portable but i'd keep your guitar and stand out away and close to a corner, if you value your guitar. not a specific knock on the hercules but most low and portable stands like this, are the same, they do keep the guitar up but a careless bump can knock it down. you may be careful around it, but it's hard to say for others nearby. for a cheap guitar, i wouldn't mind using this, but for a more expensive guitar, no thanks.Please click yes if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, i will be more than happy to answer if i can be of help.

Review: i own two hercules gs302b stands for my electric guitars, and i couldn't be happier with them. when i needed an acoustic stand i turned to the hercules gs301b and have no regrets. at the forefront of my purchasing decision was the safety of my guitars. not only do stands have to hold guitars securely, they shouldn't harm the finishes of the instrument. unfortunately many stands will harm the nitrocellulose lacquer on many higher-end guitars; since i have two guitars of this nature, protecting them was of the utmost import to me. fortunately these stands protect most nitrocellulose finishes, and i have never had problems with mine. the stands themselves (both varieties) fold up to be very compact if you need portability, and support the guitar very securely. i don't gig with these guitars, so portability was not paramount to me, but stability was: these stands are extremely stable and are very sturdy (mine reside on a carpeted floor, and i have never had any issues with them tipping over.) some people may not love the yellow and black \"bumble bee\" coloration, but i actually find it whimsically industrial. i am completely happy with all three of my hercules stands: they are safe, portable, rugged, and won't hurt the finish on most guitars. if i need another guitar stand, it's a good bet i will buy another hercules.

Review: this thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand. of course one might think that would translate into sturdy, and one would be correct. super simple to use. no buttons, levers, or knobs. just pop it open. it doesn't have an actual mechanical locking feature, but the design is such that if you fully open the outside legs they will basically lock in place. it holds my acoustic securely, and i have no fear that it's going to tip over on its own. when you're done, just nudge the outer legs to \"unlock\" them and it's super easy to fold back up.i had a fender mini acoustic stand, but it didn't fold flat enough to fit nicely in my gig bag so i figured i would try this one. i am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter. however..... i can only give it four stars because when folded the three back feet stack up and give it about a 2.75\" thickness. if hercules could have figured a way to avoid that, this baby would truly fold as flat as a magazine. it's still pretty flat and takes up less room in my bag, but i think the marketing guys used a little creative license with that description. (either that or they're comparing it to the cosmo year end recap issue.) still a great little stand and i would buy it again if needed.

Review: i was excited to get this product and use my electric guitar with garageband.this product plugs into the usb port and the guitar plugs into the 1/4&#34; port (the product specs does not show or say 1/4 plug port).my product has an orange usb light instead of a blue one. the support people at behringer tell me that they changed the color to match their logo (sounds like bs to me).the problem i had and the reason i bought this is that i tried plugging my guitar directly into the computer with a 1/4-1/8 adapter chord. it works but the levels are too low. when i received this, i was hopeful that the levels would be higher and they are, but not by much. it is a step up from the adapter, but far from professional. i'd say the level is beginner/intro level sound and quality.i bought a &#34;like new&#34; product describing faded or damaged packaging. when it arrived, the pkg box was dented (i don't care) and product looked new inside. but, all the instructions described a blue usb light and cd of driver and recording software which this did not come with. behringer gave me a link to download. i assure you it's crapware and beware. for the mac, garageband is far better and easier to use.rock out!

Review: i was previously using a rocksmith usb cable, but wanted a specific cable for my imac. this unit definitely fits the bill, and from what i can hear when playing, has an even lower latency than the rs cable. i was getting a little unwanted slapback with the rs cable, but this unit seems to have taken care of that. it's also quite nice to have a headphone jack right up front for quiet practice times.the software that comes with this interface is a joke, and is about as useful as an aol disc. since i use logic pro x and mainstage 3 it wasn't a loss to me, but if you are buying this interface for the fact it comes with &#34;amp tones&#34;, you might want to look somewhere else. i couldn't even get the software to load on my 2013 imac.

Review: this product has turned out to be great with few exceptions. it comes with three amplifier software packages and says you have the license to turn on any one of the three, not true. the license included only works for one amp, the ac box combo and not the other two, you need to purchase the license for them. plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor. you cannot run the output through your sound card to your pc speakers due to latency. you must use the headphone jack on the interface. in addition if you are in an austere environment and can't get to the internet to register your product immediately you are out of luck trying to make it work. once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product.

Review: the behringer ucg102 device is an aging (yet affordable) piece of hardware that offers the intriguing option of plugging your guitar directly into the usb port of a computer. this opens up a number of possibilities for recording or simply for playing with headphones. for the budget player, it could be argued that a mere $32 investment unlocks a world of free amp modeling and recording possibilities.however, while the actual hardware is compact and seems function properly, there are some significant problems here. first and foremost, there is the problem of getting the device to work, getting the software to recognize it, and configuring it to run without significant \"latency\" (which is a delay effect where you don't hear a played note immediately when it's played, which can make monitoring anywhere from frustrating to impossible). the ucg102 runs on an asio driver. they include an older version with the software, and you can snoop around online and find other options. but that doesn't mean it will necessarily work with your software, or work well if it does. for example, audacity is a popular \"freeware\" program you can use to record and mix audio files on the computer. i've been told that audacity doesn't work with asio drivers, and when i got it to record, the latency issues rendered it unusable.you do receive two other software options with the device. the first is energyxt2, which i believe includes a license for the compact version. in theory, this program should work like audacity and contains a number of amp models and effects, in addition to drum and bass track loops. however, i have had little luck figuring out how to monitor and record with this program. i'm sure it can work, but if you need a computer science degree to figure it out, that's really not ideal for a budget product.the second item is a trial disc with guitar combos by native instruments. so far, this has been the most impressive of the options offered. you can demo three different amp simulators (vox, fender, and marshall) and then enter a code to unlock one of the three. i like that it gives you an interface similar to a real guitar amp, which allows you to dial in some realistic tones. it's also the only program i've been able to get the headphone jack to play through both ears in (there are problems with recognizing mono vs. stereo). i adjusted the sound quality to get latency down to 8 miliseconds, which is just into the range where i don't notice it as a problem. still, while the models sound good, i'm not sure how often i would bother plugging into my computer just to do basic playing and recording.shortly after ordering this device, i discovered that my sound card has a blue \"line in\" audio jack on the back. by running a simple 1/8\" to 1/4\" audio cable from my pedal board to the sound card, i can do direct recording, which is monitored through my computer speakers (no latency) and sounds great. even better, this method works through audacity and allows me to record and layer tracks. if the ucg102 worked as advertised, it would be a more convenient way of doing this, but i simply can't recommend it for most people. i feel like there's \"4-star\" potential somewhere in this device, but i doubt i'll ever have the patience to unlock it. 3 stars.

Review: i use this 5 footer between my guitar pedals and amp. i do move it around plug and unplug it often and after two months of daily use it works as well as it did when it was brand new. i was initially concerned when i first received the cable that it would not last. the cable is not as fat as i had hoped, however the ends are solid and sturdily built. i usually use mogami gold cables and do so because budget cables are crap and only last a month or so, if that long. this hosa cable is a very good cable and i even chose to use hosa jumper cables between my over drives and effects pedals. they last.

Review: a very handy item. great for sitting by your practice amp when you don't want to be bothered with stepping all over your 10footers. the wire could be a little heavier but you can't beat the value. the plugs are the standard screw-down type with well soldered joints. i've used this, now, for quite a while and have no problems nor complaints with this cord.

Review: i thought i was buying the 10 footer and realize i ordered the 5 footer too late. let's be honest here, what good is a 5 foot amp chord unless you're sitting on the amp? my bad..i never would have ordered this as it costs the same money for the 10 footers as it does for the 5 footers. i would not recommend buying a 5 footer unless you practice in a closet.

Review: 5 feet is a weird length for a cable. it really only has one use: when you're sitting right next to your practice amp. just don't wander too far off! this cable is perfect for a kid who is going to his/her guitar lesson and has to plug in.i bought two of these for the home studio to jack in a guitar with a pedal or two in between. i feel chained to my workstation. just my experience. get a 10 foot and be free!hope it helps.

Review: these cables are very good. the metal heads at both ends are of excellent quality and you can unscrew the grip to change the pins. there is no play when i plug these into my guitar nor are they too tight- that is, the pin diameter is perfect! there's also a white protective hard paper at both ends to prevent internal short due to fatigue (which is how i lost the last two cables and which would be expected from daily guitar practice)

Review: construction and use: 5/5the connectors and shielding on these cables are good and do not introduce much noise into a system.the manufacturer has done a good job on this cable, but the user is responsible for two things (this addresses complaints i see in other reviews):1) take care of your cables. the right angle plug side is much stronger than the straight plug side; this is by design. take good care of your cables and it should last you quite a long time. this includes taking the time to store them for use.2) make sure you know what length you need for a cable. the shorter the cable, the better for studio use. it reduces signal travel time and potential for interference (though these cables are shielded so the latter concern is moot). if you need a longer cable, buy a longer cable. don't buy what is advertised as 5' cable and then write a negative review when you really needed a 15' cable.

Review: the low-e tuner on my 1985 lp standard broke about a week ago - the back came off and the tuning handle popped out. i never liked the ones that were on it but i didn't want to drop the $$$ unless i needed to. i came across these grovers. they had good reviews and the price was right.took me about 30 minutes to replace all the tuners and re-string the guitar. the tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever. they also feel more sturdy than the ones i just replaced. it's hard to say if they keep a tune better at this point as i haven't had them on for long enough - they seem better, though, as the b string with the old tuners used to always go flat quickly.i decided to use the old screws instead of the new ones that shipped with these grovers - they fit better (i.e. tighter). nothing wrong with the new screws, i just like my stuff to be snug. :)i like them and glad i purchased them - so far.

Review: i installed these on my 2000-ish epiphone les paul. they provide a very noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look. i can tune with much finer precision, and they hold that tuning with even the nastiest of bending. the ability to accurately tune and keep that tuning allows to play and sound better. i should note that i had to drill new holes or, more precisely, enlarge the holes on my guitar. i used a 3/8 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully. i'm sure the idea of drilling your guitar might sound scary, but it was actually quite easy. now they are in there nice and snug since i made the holes a bit tight.

Review: i've tried pretty much every harp out there, after having played the regional blues & jazz circuit for about 10 years. lee oskar harps are the best value.on top of it, lee oskar actually called me once just because i left a question on his website!i've met rick epping (of hohner harmonicas) at namm -great guy- but he never called me at 3:30 in the afternoon just because i could not identify a song i thought he was playing on!i carry around between 10 or 12 harps to a gig, so that is at least $290 for a set of lee oksar harps.10 suzuki manji harps, while nice and the phosphor bronze reeds are great, would cost nearly $480 - presuming you could find them.i will not say i've never blown a reed on a lo, but i will say that $22 for a new set of lo reed plates beats $48 for a new manji, at least in my book.on top of it, all they really did with the manji is discontinue the \"bushman delta frost\" harmonicas and rename them so they could double the price.lee oskar harmonicas are inexpensive, they are simple and cheap to repair, easy to play, have great tone, and are even easy to identify since the 1st & 2nd position keys are printed right on the comb. that feature is great for beginners who might not be able to keep them straight yet.give them a shot.

Review: i bought this and a hohner special 20 key of c harp to test them both out. this harp is a great harp, pretty much the exact same as the hohner special 20 in overall quality. \"feels\" a little more airtight, brighter and louder than the hohner, but in side-by-side testing the effect is diminished.the hohner special 20 just seems to have this little extra...expression to it. more life or something.both harps very bendable, etc. real high quality.as for the replaceable reed plates...amazon has this harp marked down to about the $25 level. reed plate replacements are about $19. now i realize that at retail that's half the price of a retail harp, but only $6 less than a \"whole new harp\" otherwise.with this in mind, i would generally recommend beginners start with the hohner special 20. just a slightly better or at least more fun-sounding and fun to play harp with a little more animation and expression available \"free\ in my opinion.

Review: i'm a guitarist with a passion for blues, so it was only a matter of time before i was going to pick up the harmonica. i almost went with some of the cheaper options, but i am extremely pleased with my decision. it sounds gorgeous (very full and clear), and i've already been able to start bending some notes--which i understand i notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicas.as a blues guitarist i was tempted to buy a harmonica in d or a that, when played in second-position, would allow me to play along with blues songs in a or e (two of the most common blues keys; especially among the songs i like to play). the second-position for the harp in c is g (not terribly common). however, i think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in c, since many of the beginner songs are in c, and the c major scale should be very familiar to most musicians. in other words, as i'm exploring the notes, they make a lot of sense to me. at this price, i won't mind buying a d or a when the time comes--it's not like i'm already at a level where i'm dying to play those songs anyway. and, if i need to, there are a couple of songs i've found in g (e.g., work song by butterfield). that song along should keep my practicing for a long time. if you are still reading this review, then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp, add it to your cart.

Review: for me the combination of color coding and high quality cables make this a great value.it's the cable construction that drew me to these in the first place. the insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages. however, it's the attention to small construction details that i love. the xlr ends are quality components, but cheap, ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down. and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly.another factor is the strain reliefs at each end. those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable, which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them.of course the color coding is a godsend. i can now tell at a glance what is connected to what, both live and in my home studio. i have not experienced any extraneous noise using these, but i am careful to eliminate sources or route around them. still, these are as good as any other cables i have purchased.i'll also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision. i was frankly concerned that at the price point these would turn out to be junk. not the case. i can happily say that sometimes you really do get more than you pay for.

Review: i own a jamhub greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space. this cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the jamhub colour coding system!the cables are of a pretty good quality, with solid connectors and well constructed. the cable itself is a bit 'rubbery' and not 'slinky' like some of the higher grade microphone cables, but so far they have held up fine. the cables add no noise or colouration to the signal and the colour coding makes life in the rehearsal space so much easier.

Review: we have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices. sounds great, looks great, the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight. even fixed another bands vox mic connector, his sure cable was loose in the connector, this cable was tight. has worked on...sm57, nady starpower, akg 5800s, mxl 990, marshall and mark bass amps, and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the xlr's and on the numerous mixers. and yes color rules!

Review: these cables have been solid; we use them in the studio every single day, and have held up so well compared to many others i've ordered for less.yes, $70 on cables seems like a boring way to spend that money, but don't be fooled: nothing makes you looks stupider during a recording session than a blown cable. not only do these hold up and sound great, i've found that when working with a complicated studio setup, i'm always surprised how helpful the color-coding actually ends up being. for the price, this is totally worth it.i use these with the following to really color code my studio setup:color windscreens:gls audio mic windscreens microphonecolor electrical tape:b004zzvhgwcolor patch cables:b003vybnhgdefinitely worth it! makes a huge difference!

Review: picked up this set of cords for a gig i had at a large hotel event. there were 3 audio systems going at the same time running across the front of two stages. we had 48 channels running from the stages to the back where we had a splitter send the inputs into my board, the video mix board, and then the house mix board. i had returns a-e for my subwoofer, 3 monitor mixes and a stereo main mix. i used a different color cable for each function. i had a second set for di boxes to the guitars, bass and keyboards. all of the cables worked perfectly! the video mix guy asked me where i got the cables from so he could get a set for himself. these cords made it super easy to see where my bands stuff was plugged into so at the end of the night we made short work of the cable tear down.already had 2 sets, so i ordered one more set for my studio, so i can find connections that much easier!great set of cables!

Review: i've purchased a couple of of the blue 25 foot mic cords from this seller before - same as these. i've had them for well over a year used in live music at least 5 times a month. they've been stepped on, and treated pretty rough. they are still supple and easy to wind up. in contrast; i have other mic cords from a different manufacturer and the set screws have fallen out, they are stiffer and just haven't held up as well. having the multicolor cords makes it a lot easier to see which channel on the mixer is connected to which mic. very inexpensive yet reliable cord. highly recommended.

Review: , i'm purchasing another. this is the best price/value purchase i've made in a long time. i'm not going to insult your intelligence and say it's the same as the other well-known mic that looks the same, but for my ears and everybody else who's listened to this mic, it sounds clear and clean and is a little hotter than my sm 58. i just used it to play a show on friday the 24th, and it performed wonderfully. the sound guy thought it was an sm 58. i will definitely buy a couple of the es-57s as well to mic up some amps. now, things may change in a year if the mic doesn't hold up, but it is hefty and solid, and seems to be built like a tank. now, if i was dripping money, maybe i would stick with the \"industry standard,\" but when you can buy these at a 3:1 dollar ratio, why on earth should i?2/6/2014 update: i must say that in some venues, you'll really have to tweak the eq in order to stop feedback. so while they are a great value, they feedback in some situations where my sennheisers do not (but they were 4 times the price. . .).

Review: i wouldn't consider this a $30 backup mic, i would consider this a professional vocal mic. period. this is a great mic! out of the box, it has a nice weight to it. it sounds slightly hotter than say, a shure sm58; which is why i like it so much. i typically like to stand back from a mic when i sing live and this seems to work very well for my vocals with that technique. i have also tested this mic with harmonica as well. seriously... i don't work for the company or have any ties whatsoever. i'm just a dude in a band. trust me on this one.

Review: i had high hopes for this replacing my pedal board but there are a couple of things i don't like about it. it has a button clip on the back which is non-removable so makes it all but useless if you don't put it on your belt. i don't know about you but wearing something on my belt with two 1/4 inch cables is quite a feat. add to that possible lines for headphones and an a/c adapter and you look like octoman.and what possible function does the kidney bean shape make other than making it odd to put down anywhere with the belt clip sticking out. the menu is accessed by using a 4 position finger pad. the main rotaries on the front have two functions depending whether you are holding another key down to access the second set. this is extremely difficult to do if you need to switch between settings in a live environment. i have had multiple mistakes and frustrations.imho the pod really belongs on a desktop for daw recording. it doesn't have much value on your belt clip. still have my effects rack.

Review: i scored a virtually unused pre-owned unit for $50. it is packed with features and there is a little bit of a learning curve if you want to really make use of the features, but simple plug and play operation is possible. my original thought was to use the unit as an interface for recording on my pc. my only gripe- and it is considerable - is that the unit sounds too digital to me- particularly as the chord or note starts to decay and fade. i probably would have loved this thing when i started playing (more years ago than i care to admit). i prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals. does that make me a 'gear snob'? not when you consider that low watt tube amps and cheaply manufactured pedals can be had for peanuts these days ;) i've also owned a tech 21 trademark 60 analog modeling amp (not bad but traded) and still have a tech 21 tri ac analog preamp(great pedal and a keeper)- both are 'modelers' and both sounded better to my ears than digital modelers. i just prefer analog all the way around. i eventually gave the unit away to someone who has just taken up the guitar. he likes it fine- i gave 3 stars because it's a good way for junior to experement with effects and to practice without annoying the neighbors.

Review: the good:this is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.the bad:the tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination, unless you like hyper-distorted noise. the cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied. the effects are hit and miss as well. plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive.throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, i'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones.

Review: i had a line 6 pod that worked only on the computer and was great for effects and stuff but not the best for actually practicing away from the computer and decided it was time to change that. i considered a few different brands and even other line 6 pod models. i even ordered a pod xt only to cancel that order when i realized that you can download tones from the line 6 website and add them into the user memory banks for easy retrieval.as many have said, the batteries that come with it did not last long at all, but that was kind of expected. i have since been using energizers and those are lasting long enough for my needs, plus i have a 9 volt ac adapter that works great, especially when i am recording.to use it for recording, simply output from the headphone jack to the input on your laptop or desktop computer and you'll be able to record with all the tones you could want! i downloaded a joe satriani sound and am so happy with it that i have already recorded myself playing one of his songs with it and it sounds great!i am not going to knock a star off for this since they obvously put a belt clip on it for a reason, but if you are like me and still like to sit it on a desk every now and then, it will not stay put by itself as it is not heavy enough, but i found that you can put two rubber bands on either side of it and it helps it to &#34;grip&#34; better and stay put so that it doesn't slide right off.i am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to any guitarist out there who needs some great tones to practice with. i don't play live so i cannot say how well it would work for that.

Review: i wanted a portable headphone amp but bought this instead because it was only a few bucks more and offers a ton more features. though it's not perfect, it's like having a room full of guitar effects and different amps.pros: 32 amp models, 16 cabinet models, effects + thousands of available presets = tones galore; good software for managing tones and creating new ones; can be used in front of an amp (in case you want to know how a modeled mesa/boogie would sound coming out of a real Vox); lots of connectivity; compact enough that i keep the unit, the cable and the power supply in my case; no tech problems at all; built-in noise gate and tuner; easy-to-use tap feature.cons: there's a learning curve and you will need the manual to know stuff like how to change amp models; manual is a pdf file; hard to keep track of preset tones on the unit (though you can rename and re-arrange them with the software); presets based on famous songs don't always sound right; minor background hum; uses 4 aaa's in a few hours and the manual says don't use rechargables (though it doesn't say why); for legal reasons, the unit uses generic amp names (check the manual to match the amp model names to the amps they're based on); with everything plugged in the whole setup becomes a little unwieldy; doesn't sound as nice as a good pedal and a marshall half stack (no kidding, right? and i still don't sound like alvin lee).as an inexpensive effects box that also works as a portable headphone amp, this thing is cool. you won't get bored with it but you will need to learn how to use it. master some of the amp/cab models and how to tweak them for gain, reverb, delay, etc. before you dive into the presets. and once you've got the presets you like best, use the software to put them all in one place so you can find them easily.the line 6 pocket pod pack includes a patch cord, power supply, usb cable, cd, cheap ear buds, and mp3 player cable. the pack is 150 new, so if you're going to buy the power supply then just get the pack. if you buy used then the manual describes how to do a factory reset so it's like new again.

Review: i've been using a one spot to power a gator small pedalboard for about 8 years now. in that time i've done probably over 200 gigs and i've never had a problem. is it super quiet? no, but when you have pedals and amps with gain and single coil pickups, there will be noise. it's a fact of life. i've never found it to be excessive. turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when you're not playing.I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable solution to powering their pedalboard.

Review: like many guitar players, i have a few effects pedals of different brands and i needed an alternative to nine volt batteries to power them. at one of the guitar forums i frequent i started a thread about powering a ts9 tube screamer with a non-proprietary nine volt power supply, one spot came back twice in the replies. since that time i acquired a two more pedals so now i really needed something. i looked into powered pedal boards but decent boards were too expensive and too bulky me. i got creative, i ordered a one spot combo pack then bought some 2\" wide industrial strength velcro and built my own board that fits in my hard-shell brief case.so far so good, after two months of band practices the one spot 9v dc adapter with the multi plug daisy chain cable does what i bought it for, my little four pedal setup works beautifully. i'm perfectly happy it. the one spot adapter is well made and the cable is ten feet long so it should be long enough to reach your stage power source. the combo pack also includes protective caps for the unused plugs on the multi plug daisy chain.if you are thinking about buying this product, do it. if you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals, here is a compatibility chart.[...]power to the pedals, rock on!!!!

Review: one spot has become the standard. it is not cheap, but it is well made and useful. with this, you get the power adapter, the extension cable (to hook up multiple stomp boxes), and a bag full of converter cables. the power adapter is smartly built so that it will only take up one slot on your surge protector or in your wall outlet.so far, i have used it successfully only to power two pedals, so i cannot speak to how it handles powering an entire pedal board. but i am sure it would do so without issue as i have seen other do it without a complaint.

Review: so i recently purchased the visual sound one spot combo pack and i must say i am quite pleased. i was checking out some of the higher end products (t-rex fuel tank, voodoo lab pedal power) and just didn't feel like forking over the money. maybe one day if i'm going to be playing gigs on the regular and can afford to pay around $200 i'll go for one of the other products, but from what i read on the visual one power supply i was willing to take a risk (especially for the great price)currently i'm powering 4 hardwire pedals, a dunlop wah pedal and the berhinger cs400 (see, i'm cheap sometimes - but effectively so) so i'm already using 6 of the 8 power supply cables. all pedals are powered without issue, without noise, there is no hum or hiss or delay or negative effect whatsoever! i can't say enough how excited i was to see this as a viable option for powering the pedal board i just put together, and when it came through and worked flawlessly, it was all the better. i would highly recommend this product to any beginner guitarist starting to fiddle with effects pedals, or even a moderate or novice player - it's simply a reliable and affordable way to power your pedal board. 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!rock on

Review: this is great product if you are chaining several pedals together. using just one wall wart you can power all of them, at least those that receive this kind of power 9v. where it went above and beyond duty was providing a l6 converter 'cl6' for line 6 products. i have an m-audio black box which had a peculiar size plug. it was 9v 1000ma but nothing would fit. then i tried the l6 converter and bingo i'm in business and black box bliss. i would recommend having it around just for that. it costs about the same as 1 odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you can't find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters. a pedal junkies salvation.

Review: i like this for getting rid of all those extra adaptors you have to have a special power strip for, and it works well for most of my ibanez, mxr and boss pedals that have an outside adaptor socket. it doesn't seem to work so well with my vox wah, my old mxr distortion plus and my fulltone pedals. i'm using the 9v battery adaptor for the wah and my dist+, and i get a really weird random squealy noise from the wah (not the same one you get when the wah is not playing well with another pedal in your chain) and intermittant operating problems with the dist+. i get a slightly louder hum from the fulltone pedals when they're on, but my newer boss/ibanez/mxr pedals have no issues at all. the one spot is not a regulated power supply (if it was, they'd say so), so maybe that's the culprit; not sure.

Review: if you are using two or more pedal effects this should be on your standard equipment list with the price of 9volt batteries you can't afford not to purchase this rig. if you need it, there's enough wiring to have space between your pedals. but the wiring is thin enough to be able to stuff it into a crammed pedal board. a great feature is the disconnect plug that gives you the ability to disconnect the wiring harness from the 9volt adapter the 9volt adaptor comes with plenty of wire so you can have your pedals or board in a convenient position.

Review: quite a few people are complaining about the buzz caused/induced by this. i'm not getting any. i use an old arion stage tuner, a digitech bad monkey and cm-2 tube overdrive, a dunlap wah from the 90s, and a boss ns-2 noise suppressor. i run it all into a fender deville 410, which additionally runs into an acoustic b115 neo bass cab for extra mmmph.at first i thought it was the noise suppressor. but even when it's off, i'm getting absolutely no buzz from my effects.for the price this is amazing. to be able to have all of my effects powered with one plug is a godsend. the cables are very long, maybe too long, if that's possible. if you're even thinking about buying this, just buy it already!!!!

Review: granted this is no voodoo laps pedal power, or another isolated power supply, but it does provide clean, quiet daisy chain power for up to 8 pedals, and does so pretty dang great for $150+ cheaper.is it silent? no.is it reliable? yes.would i use it on stage or in the studio? yes.would i prefer something nicer if $$$ weren't an issue? yes.does this wok great on a budget, absolutely!!if you're tired of using batteries pick this thing up!if you're a super quiet signal chain snob, save an extra $150 and get the voodoo labs.

Review: i bought this power supply for in home use - i don't do too much gigging or recording, so this is primarily used for practicing or just messing around. the product works very well; i'm able to power 5 of my pedals easily. the cords are plenty long in length, however it is a bit difficult to chain together longer pedals with some shorter ones without the two pedals being right next to each other (i.e. having a wah pedal next to a standard size pedal). however, that is only a minor complaint and in no way effects the usability of the product. i haven't had to use any of the special adapters though, but i plan on getting a line 6 dl-4, so having the line 6 adapter is a great added touch. best of all, all of your power needs for all your pedals only takes up one outlet spot in your home. i've been using this product for months now and have no complaints. you can't beat the price.

Review: versus the godlyke, i'd say this is the better purchase. though the godlyke product claims 2000ma of power (2amps), this is slighlty less at 1.7ma (1700ma or 1.7amps). anyway, if your drawing that much juice using your pedal board, you may want to re-consider what you are using. the product itself is plastic, but seems solid, i believe it will hold up to repeated use no problem. being plastic though, you do have to be careful not to drop it or have it stepped on or rolled over, etc. i do like the fact that it does have a heavier gauge wire than the godlyke product and seems slimmer so it will fit more readily into '1 spot' as advertised. the heavier wire means that when someone rolls in their 4x12 cab your power supply cable will have a higher chance of survival. the extender that comes with is good, seems about as generic in length and space between connections as you can get. i only wish it came with two of them. i am using a pedaltrain pro board and at 32.9 inches, it will require a pair of the extensions to get to all the pedals. the combo pack also includes some other adapters for those odd pedals that refuse to conform and use 1/8\" power connections, some 9 volt adapters for pedals with out any external power. one thing i have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply. a lot of companies think that if their voltage is 'close' to 9 volts, thats good enough. the reality is that this is an indication of poor quality control and lack of intrest in producing a quality product. you will find some higher end devices specifically warn not to use anything higher than 9 volts so 9.6 volts isn't 'close enough'. anyway, while i have not checked the output of the adapter yet, i did fire it up on all the pedals i could power with the one extension that came with and everything worked nice and quiet. it is amazing how having a good quality power source can help eliminate some buzz and other 'noise' from your signal chain. i'd buy this again and in fact i may buy another just as a back up. it is a tad pricey at thirty bucks... feels more like a twenty five dollar item given the all plastic construction but, all in all, a good buy over the competition.

Review: sometime round 1994, my friend kendal built several of these for our band. they were great and incredibly handy. i havent investigated this, but i wondered later when i started seeing them marketed if he had developed the first one or not. certainly, if he did, he never patented it or anything.anyway, flash forward 18 years and here i was sitting with my row of stompboxes, resenting batteries and individual power supplies. i thought back fondly to my first sound combo power supply and realized i needed to invest in one again....and so i did. this one comes with some slip covers for any unused adapters. so far, it has lived up to my expectations. i cat speak to playing out with this yet, as i am mostly messing around in my little home studio, but i definitely havent heard any crackle on my recordings or when just amping up and letting loose. so, for such a simple device, you really cant beat it...unless you dont really use boxes. personally, i presently have my wah, distortion, chorus, overdrive, delay, slap echo, and flanger running through it. everything works great.enjoy!

Review: i was new to pedal effects, new to pedal boards, and new to the challenge of how to power it all. i did my research and settled on pedal train for the board (the mini, with case) and the one spot for power. this bundle--including an 8-pedal chain, a few adapters and the power supply--does it all. in fact, it may be overkill. i only have 5 pedals, so i have to hide/secure the rest of the chain with twist ties. and the adapters, never used 'em. but it is a complete kit. if you need more than this, i don't know what to tell ya.

Review: i once dreamed of something like this around 1979 when guitar player magazine had a plan to build such a thing. it has 9 volt battery adapaters so that if you have a few mxr pedals from 1979, they will work on this setup. for those who have 9 volt power adapters of the more modern kind, they fit these, too. i got all sorts of stuff plugged in; mini amp, flanger (has ac), equalizer, compressor, fuzz, wah. love my gizmos. say good bye to batteries. this is very affordable, too, given the high number of effects it will supply. i could find nothing better on the market for the price and features.

Review: this is a terrific product. while the price might seem a little high for a power adapter, it actually serves the function of what you might need several other adapters and daisy chains to accomplish.the key to the onespot is the 1700ma output. by comparison, the boss psa-120 adapter puts out 200ma. since most stompboxes draw between 5 and 60 ma of power, you could only reliably chain up to about 3 or 4 of them with the boss adapter.the combo kit is a great value because it comes with a daisy chain for up to eight pedals, and some other parts for hookups to a 9v adapter or other jacks that i don't use on my pedals. i use it with boss and ibanez pedals and it works great. best of all, there's no added electric \"buzzing\" noise, which is a problem with many budget power solutions.also like how the cable hookups are angled instead of straight - makes much more sense for a tight pedalboard. no more 9v's and no more hooking up multiple cables every time - one simple plug and i'm ready to play!

Review: what makes it better is that it is a kit with most of what you need to power up to 8 pedals. it comes with various adapters and even has rubber caps to cap of the power outlets you arent using! powers pedals that have negative tip -like boss, maxon, ibanez, etc, etc. even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal! also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip!!!one of the best features is that the power plugs are at right angles so they don't stick straight out on pedals that have side jacks...takes up less room on your pedal board. also the 8 plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables.the other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss..it can put out up to 1700ma...which is how it can run up to 8 pedals.a great item at a great price. no brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more.

Review: it does what it says it will, but it's still not a great pedalboard solution. the distance between the plugs is sometimes too short. also, if you're not using all the plugs, you've got a dangling end you've got to try and stash or tie off. again it's a good item for what it does but it has inherent problems if you're pedalboard has varying distances between pedals.

Review: getting a proper pedal power unit (like voodoo labs, dc brick, ciok) is recommended. even though this has a lot of outlets, each pedal may not receive enough power. i usually use this to power two or three pedals and most of the time it is ok. any more than that, and you will have some loss of headroom in the pedals. may not power some pedals that have a high current draw.

Review: i have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time. i have bought $150 pedals and $100 pedals and i got this one for $25 and it blows all the others out of the water. the only down side to this pedal is that you either need to run it off a 9volt or the behringer power supply. i couldn't get it to work properly with my pedalboard power or my pyle-pro ppdlp02 dc supply. the plastic case feels like it may break at anytime but aside from that i love this pedal more than a puppy playing a harp in the middle of a daisy field in michigan.

Review: i got this by mistake, confusing it with the tremolo effect. but, either way, i liked it and decided to keep it. it's a really good deal at the price. and it sounds just as good as major brands. the only problem most people find is the material that it's made of. it's like a hard plastic, not metal like most are. but, if you're not a person who abuses your gear, it should last you a good while.i cannot use it for recording, because there is some hiss from it, like all other behringer pedals, and i record direct, not through amp. but, for live playing, it's great. it's especially perfect for garage and bar bands.

Review: i had fairly low expectation for a ~$25 pedal, but many people said it sounded very close, if not better, than a vintage boss vb-2. considering i didn't want to spend 20x this pedal, i can't compare the 2 but can say it works very well. it can do subtle low-rate, low-depth to fast shimmers to ridiculous warbles. the rise knob seems to act as a reverse level control, or at least turning it up weakens the effect (which i guess is good, i might swap around the leads). finally, a non-blue led is used, which means it won't blind you when you try to adjust the settings.being $25 however, the plastic case is noticeably cheaper quality and looking compared to even behringer's $50 pedal, and the hinge is a little less stable. it will still hold up with moderate use. however, it could wear out if you plan on heavily using the latch feature (which is a momentary mode).

Review: summarygreat pedal, buy it, you'll probably keep it! at its price point - 5 stars. i am keeping it and it is probably going to become a permanant addition to my pedalboard. only time will tell but i like adding some vibrato for clean sounds. it reminds me a lot of how i used to set up my super reverb amp. compared to all pedals, i'd actually give it 4 stars - downgrading 1 star for the plastic case and the limited functionality of the rise control. but i liked it so much i decided to score it \"at its price point\".pros- dirt cheap at $25 for a new pedal- sounds great - does not add or subtract any frequencies or add any noise (i wish i could say the same for some $200 pedals i've tried.)- latched/unlatched mode -- the best feature on the pedal. i love that i can put this in unlatched mode and use it to vibrato in short bursts.- small form factor - normal \"single pedal\" size- standard power supply - 9v center negative - runs from pedal board power or a battery- the larger foot pedal surface (compared to just a silver bullet switch) is nice for the unlatched mode usecons- cheap plastic case - i doubt its durability and would have preferred to pay more for a more durable case.- latched/unlatched switch is small (hard to reach, have to bend over, can't do with a toe)- rise control has only the most subtle impact on sound. probably not needed on this pedal. two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability.- like most pedals - the knobs are super small and not easily controlled with a toe, and the settings are hard to see. my favorite pedals have large knobs, well marked settings you can see from a distance, enough space between the knobs to set one without bumping another, and in the best cases, enough space, size, and durability for the knobs to be tweakable by a foot or toe bump.suggested redesign, \"super vibrato\" or \"vibrato ii\"1) change to a metal case2) lose the rise control altogether3) put the latched/unlatched modes on a 2nd stomp switch so you can stomp to go between modes4) increase the size of and space between the other two controls -- put large \"foot controllable\" knobs with high visibility knobs.then again, at 25 bucks, i might just buy a 2nd one and put one in latched and one in unlatched mode.

Review: i've used the fx600 for a couple of years. i've got a pedal board, with several pedals, but if i had to take only one pedal with me, (and i often do, when i have to travel lite), this is the pedal i take. not only do i get a full selection of effects, but the pedal doubles as a di unit, solving input issues on some problem sound systems i've played thru. that's probably an unintended benefit, but i find it a valuable feature, which gives me confidence to play thru any system. fyi, my buddy's digitech multi-effect pedal actually introduces hum into systems, where this (fx600) has helped me get a cleaner sound. while this unit has no tone adjustments, it also adds 'something' to make my guitars sound better (i know that is sort of vague). the only down side of this pedal that i have found is that, because they have jammed so much stuff into one pedal, it is a little hard to make precise adjustments. but, with what this pedal does do for me, that's a small price to pay. for this price, i can't see why anyone would not like this pedal.

Review: i've been playing for about 17 years. most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in columbus, ga. my performance guitar is a martin hd-28 and my practice guitar is a blueridge br-180.i wanted a third guitar just for kicks. i'd been looking a taylors, but didn't want to spend that much money.enter the seagull s6. a fellow picker asked if i'd ever heard of a seagull - i hadn't - he said they were nice guitars and i ought to check them out. so, i did a little research. i first read all the nice reviews here for the s6 and then went on youtube and listened to a few. my guitar is a seagull coastline spruce s6 and i really like it. i choose not to get the cedar top version because the cedar is soft, and i understand that the spruce has more volume. i got the s6 today and this evening my wife, with her taylor gs mini, and i, with this s6, played smokey mountain memories. nice, real nice guitar.i found that the action on this s6 is pretty good out of the box. i'm going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pin/peg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time, if he can make the action better, i'll let him. i'm also going to put on some elixir light strings. i don't know what kind of strings are on it out of the box.but, the bottom line is that i am very happy with the playablilty and the action of this seagull coastline spruce s6 acoustic guitar right out of the box. i'm glad i bought it.

Review: seagull guitars have intrigued me for years in photos and on their website, but there is no dealer anywhere near me, so i bought one sight-unseen from amazon, based on the good reviews. i'm glad to say i can add my voice to the chorus of praise for this innovative design.a traditionalist will need some time to become accustomed to the unusual appearance and construction. the narrow, reverse-taper headstock and wide fingerboard give this guitar a bottom-heavy look when viewed vertically. back and sides are cherry with only a light stain, and the binding is dark. the top is natural cedar.as dreadnoughts go, this one is very comfortable to play sitting down. it appears to be based on the martin outline, but with a slightly rounder lower bout and a narrower upper bout. weight is pleasantly light, and the semi-gloss finish is comfortable to the touch. players with broad fingers will appreciate the wide fingerboard, but those with small hands should consider the \"\"slim\" version, with a neck 0 8\" narrower at the nut.sound is what really counts, however, and this canadian dreadnought has nothing to be ashamed of there. the maker has the good sense to ship the instrument with high-quality, fresh strings, allowing the new owner to appreciate the notable bass and clear midrange as soon as it is tuned up. overall, it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category, with good volume.buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer. both the nut and saddle on my guitar needed lowering, and the truss rod required adjustment (a long-reach hex wrench is included). if you are not experienced in these tasks, a local luthier should do it for no more than $30 or so.based on sound, playability once adjusted, and construction quality, this guitar should definitely be included when comparing instruments in this price range. it is a real standout in value.update 8 dec 2012: the more i play this guitar, the more i love it. it delivers balanced sound with good dreadnought \"snap\ and once the action was dialed in, the broad fingerboard relieves finger crowding i didn't fully realize hindered my playing. i am considerng replacing my takamine mini-jumbo with a seagull equivalent.

Review: although not through amazon.com, i recently purchased a seagull s6 original acoustic guitar. i compared this with a variety of other brands in the price range, as well as with the seagull entourage acoustic-electric which was also in the general price range. the s6 has a nicely consistent tone which, although maybe a little too bright for some players' tastes, projects very well. some reviewers and guitarists with whom i've talked wonder how seagull can produce instruments that sound as well as they do in north america for the price. i think that i found part of the answer when i looked inside some of the seagulls. the braces do not look as uniform and neatly finished as they might on other guitars. looking at the outside of the guitar and listening to it, though, you'd never know. i find the 1.8\" neck width at the nut to be great for fingerpicking work and left-hand fingering. it's a compromise between a more standard acoustic neck width and a classical guitar neck width. for me, it works. some players who are more used to a more traditionally narrow neck might not appreciate this attribute of the guitar. seagull does offer other models, by the way, that have a more traditional width. the slightly shorter scale reminds me of the scale gibson uses on many of its electric guitar models: just shorter enough to better enable chord fingering, but not so short as to cause floppy strings. i couldn't be happier with the seagull s6, especially for the price!

Review: i heard great things about the s6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, i bought it based upon reviews. i've played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:- the seagull is comparatively unattractive. its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- the cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- the laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;/resonant during playing.- the satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- the cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- the treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- the frets are smaller than competitors but are ok.- the binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something i've not encountered before.- i can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!all in all, it is an ok instrument that stands out simply because it's made in canada for asian/mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. in fact, for the price range, i can get a just-as-good asian/mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.i don't regret getting it, but i feel like i overpaid for what i received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, i have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. seagull to me is over-hyped.thanks for reading!

Review: . this guitar sounds even better. i went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic \"just for fun\" and i had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket. to my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior. you see i learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will \"open up\" and keep sounding better. yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of. it will increase in value (to you at least).

Review: i take this thing out of my rig every once in awhile, but it always finds its way back in. unlike kaga, i put it at the end of my chain, right before a boss line selector, for multiple amps. i used to put it at the beginning of my chaing, during my metal days, and it does well there too. i'm more blues orientated now, and love it at the end. with my fuzzes i can have them cracked and nice and lightly smooth, then at the end with the eq, i got it jacked up! unlike most people i love a bass players v on my eq. i love that bass, but i play through 10's and 15's and those speakers handle it better than 12's, although i do have a 2x12 with v30's in it and it sounds nice. this is a must have pedal though, no matter what you want your sound to end up like, if you have crapy stuf and just need an edge or really nice stuff and looking for that last bit of tone, you got it with this thing.

Review: bottom line up front: if you play an orange, vox, or marshall, you don't necessarily need an eq pedal, but putting one in your signal chain will take your amp to the next level.why is this? well, the brits design their amps with wide and musical eq but the overall frequency response is narrow. this has led many british amp manufacturers to include specialized tone shaping buttons on the control panel because they are well aware that british eq isn't as dramatic as american guitarists want it to be. there is nothing wrong with this by any means - it's just an overall characteristic of british amplifiers.secondly, any tube amp loves to be pushed with boost and dirt pedals to get extra crispy overdrive from the clean channel - since distortion channels on tube amps have a tendency to compress and limit the output slightly. this pedal is more than capable of providing that boost. +15db seems to be right amount to push clean to dirty, or dirty to overdrive, or overdrive to distortion.live performance: if you're in a rock band that plays small venues like bars and clubs, you've probably noticed that most bands have overwhelming bass/midrange noise (100~500hz) that drowns out the vocals and clarity of the drums or any instrument for that matter. applying eq to your signal chain will allow you to clean up your tone by cutting some unnecessary low-end from the picture and boosting your high-end for better clarity.recording direct-in: if you're using this pedal with a di box or simply plugging directly into your audio interface for virtual reamping, you'll be able to get a more balanced signal if you want to darken your strat or brighten your les paul.why 4 stars? yes, the noise. it's not bothersome by any means, but if you're recording with a mic'd amp or direct in, you will absolutely need a noise suppressor. i use my ge-7 with the boss ns-2, and the ns-2 completely removes the white noise generated from the ge-7. the result is an amazing, clean boosting eq.if you're on the fence... go ahead and get this thing. you won't regret it. it's not just for tone snobs, it can really make cheap gear sound way better, and take great gear to the next level.

Review: product arrived in exactly condition as described by the seller. this unit allows for great sweeping of frequencies. the 15 db pull in each direction for each of the seven bands are filter worthy, my only dissatisfaction lies in the amount of noise this unit adds to my chain when engaged. when inactive this unit is transparent, no tone suckage. when this unit is engaged, each frequency band carves the sounds nicely however, consideration to have this unit modified to reduce its noisy output has begun for me at least. i am thankful for the internet and the opportunities it presents for me to mod this pedal.

Review: i've had this pedal since the mid-90's, when i started playing in my teens. while an eq might seem like an odd choice for a beginner's pedal selection, i was mainly trying to compensate for the crappy bass and mid-range of the cheap crate and marshall amps i used back then. since i have better equipment now, i haven't used it as much.however, as simple as it is, it is definitely a useful tool. you can leave it on all the time to mold your sound with greater detail than most amps would have with knobs. or, you can the on-board volume to crank up the volume for solos or louder parts.the only negatives i recall from using it were that it added a bit of a hissing noise (but not so much that you couldn't trap it with a noise gate), and it seemed to take away from the sustain of notes just a bit. again, nothing that can't be fixed with other effects. and if you think about how important equalization is with stereo equipment, it only makes sense that you might want that level of control in a guitar amp as well.i give it 5 despite the minor flaws because it does what it says and boss products are built rock solid. i'll have this thing forever.

Review: i use this to patch in four ports from abbe di-400 4 channel active direct box direct injection di boxand two from analesis mic tube duo stereo tube microphone preamplifierinto a mixer. first, the size is perfect in my rack configuration. the cables easily reach, and the color coding makes it a snap to see at a glance what is connected to what. that is a great improvement over tags and labels that require you to get close to read.what makes these a bargain is construction. the insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages. however, it's the attention to small construction details that i love. the xlr ends are quality components, but cheap, ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down. and unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly. another factor is the strain reliefs at each end. those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable, which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them.overall each cable in this set is constructed to withstand frequent set-up and teardown, and is built to last. if you are shopping for patch cables in this size these are a great value in my opinion because you will probably not have to replace them for years.

Review: this stand was very inexpensive and i thought i could save a bit of money and give it a try for use with my epi sheraton ii. unfortunately i am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand. it seems to be built well enough for what it is, but it seems quite unbalanced and always on the verge of tipping backwards. also, for left/right stability you need to set the guitar just so in the bottom support piece or it seems 'tippy'.the construction itself is 'ok'. the rubber tips on the feet seem fine, but the front legs seem overly long with the rear foot overly short. the body cradle is nicely padded but isn't firmly seated inside the center tube and even though it has a rudimentary locking design, it just isn't all that solid. you can adjust the height but just inserting the top piece into the bottom caused deep scratches in the black paint of the top tube piece. it ships with an unsightly white upc sticker which must be tediously removed if you want it to look good onstage.granted, the sheraton ii is a large and heavy guitar but the onstage is billed as \"heavy duty\" and to me that means solid, which this stand just isn't, at least with larger guitars or basses. when you use a guitar stand you can't afford to be dealing with something that is in the least bit temperamental or you risk damaging your instrument and possibly even your livelihood.bottom line, you get what you pay for. for smaller, lighter guitars, strats and such, it may be ok, but for dots, sheratons, 335's and larger gretch's, i just wouldn't trust it and that goes for most basses as well.i will need to look for something else.

Review: the fulltone full drive 2 is another incarnation of the original fulldrive. now with mosfet circuitry available via toggle switch, this just makes the pedal even more flexible. not to mention boutique quality at a working man's price.this device is built solid and sports a powder blue coat finish. the volume knob gives you lots of gain, the tone knob is a \"presence\" control, the overdrive knob adjusts the level of overdrive, and then there is the boost level. yes, this is a 2-switch pedal, so when you are playing a chunky rhythm you can step on the \"boost: switch for a great lead tone.the toggle switch in between the tone and drive knobs affect the pedals tonal character as well as how the knobs affect each other. there is \"comp cut\" allowing for a cleaner boost, fm for \"flat mids,\" and \"vintage\" for a more tubescreamer tone.as a bonus, the pedal is also capable of running on 18v power for cleaner headroom, which is handy for hum bucker pick-ups.if you have the scratch and are, looking for a perfect od pedal then look at the fulldrive 2. it may wind up having a permanent position on your pedal board.

Review: holy buckets of tone batman!let me start by saying, i'm always on the quest for great amazing tone. i think it ends here. this pedal is absolutely remarkable. built like a tank, i'm pretty sure it will out live me. its full of sonic options.the overdrive has a level, tone and overdrive. almost self explanatory except the tone is more of a presence knob and less of an eq which is a total plus in my book. it also has a mini toggle for comp cut, fm, and vintage modes. the comp cut is more of a clean boost to push your amps front end, the fm is really transparent, and the vintage mode gets you that creamy midrange bite.yes, this may be another tube screamer clone, but it's a darn great one.the added mosfet circuitry toggle gives it a lovely growl your low-end fattening it up, if thats your cup of tea, while the standard leaves it more transparent. you should know this switch does effect the whole signal, not just that of the boost side.on to my only negative check on this pedal, the boost only works when the od is on. it is not a boost to be run in series with the overdrive, just additional circuitry to add more gain to your od signal.another great feature, this pedal can be run at different volts from 9v-18v.running at standard 9v gets you easier breakup, whereas 18v will get you more headroom.this pedal won't be leaving my board, probably ever. if you're even thinking about it, just do it!!! you'll never regret it.

Review: so far so good with this pedal. nice clean boost and a good overdrive sound when the second stage is activated.i mainly play relatively clean through a tube amp and use this pedal to simply cut through on the leads.i don't use this pedal for searing leads or ultra dirty sounds - just a little dirt - and two levels of it.it makes a good single channel amp act like a three channel amp and so far it is working great!main amps - 1960 bassman - 2012 fender hot rod deluxe - 1957 fender bandmaster - these amps sound great with this pedal - i don't use all three at the same time but one of these amps is with me when i play out.this pedal is very versatile and there are lots of good sounds in there so you will probably find something you like in there - but i don't think it will metal very well by itself but it would kick the front end of a good tube amp into another level of distortion pretty good. 09/27/2013still lovin' this pedal. you gotta run it on 18 volts to really wake it up.this pedal has a lot of various dirty sounds - and is very versatile.I would purchase another if i needed it.worth every penny.

Review: ever notice how every youtube video has pedals being demoed with either a strat or a tele? we we can debate why that is but one thing for certain is it is tough to get an accurate idea of what an lp will sound like till after you unbox it. after hours of research i decided on the fd2 since it seemed to have a lot of tuning options and i actually found a review using an lp into a clean amp.[...]essentially, you get 3 modes which have varing degrees types of od and a second boost mode to push things even father. what i liked about this pedal is you can use the comp cut or flat mids with an lp and not increase the bottom end or mids which often teles or strats need. hence, you can go from slight boost to huge gain without turning into mud like some pedals will do. the only downside is with so many options you will constantly be playing with the knobs and switches and finding new sounds. works fantastically with modeling amps which need varying amounts of clean and dirty od depending on what you are modeling.

Review: every guitarist needs a good tuner! and everyone knows boss makes some of the best products. the fact is tho i really cant afford to spend 90-100usd for a tuner! when i received this unit i decided first thing i was going to do was to compare it to my other hand held chromatic tuners. they all work the same. using this pedal i am able to obtain the same results, that's good enough for me. activating the tuner takes a little over 2-3 seconds, but that's fine since i usually tune within breaks and you hardly need to tune especially when you have a good guitar/tuning pegs.

Review: look at this pedal. look at what it does, and what it costs. $30 for a tuner in a pedal form factor, and that's if you don't even try to hunt down a lower price. by contrast, boss's tu-2 is essentially the same thing in a more durable housing, and it costs $100 retail.yes, the housing is made of plastic. i don't know about you, but i generally won't be leaping with both feet onto my tuner in the middle of a set. if you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever, it should survive. and if it doesn't, so what? it's cheap to replace.the other person on here obviously got a faulty model, which happens. mine's developed a touchy input jack over time (it's actually the earlier tu-100 model), but i don't know that it's totally unexpected on a pedal this cheap. one star off for these kinds of quality control problems, just to be fair. i own three other behringer pedals as well, and they're still going strong.a tuner is an essential part of any musician's rig, and this does the job just fine. use the money you save towards buying a really nice stompbox that will actually affect your sound while playing.update: after having used a new tuning pedal for some time, i will admit that, yes, this is a subpar tuner. however, i still stand by my original opinion that for the amount of money you pay, this isn't a bad investment. for a guitarist just starting out, this would still make a good first tuner when you really want to spend your money on pedals that will affect your sound.

Review: this is not a gigging pedal. you do not have time to tune with this pedal at a gig, so if you're planning on gigging in the next month or so spend the $50 on a korg. however if you're an at-home player who just wants to not have to mess around with regular electric tuners, this is worth the price. it sits right on the pedal board, the signal flies through it when it's off so there's no monkeying with your cables everytime you want to switch between standard and drop d, and it's as accurate as the korg is. it's just also slow. it takes a good 2-3 seconds to register a change, which is fine when you're just practicing or even for recording at home where a few seconds aren't crucial. i just recommend something a little faster if you need to tune quickly between songs.

Review: when i purchased this pedal from a local music store i wasn't even looking for a double pedal set, but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my tama stagestar kit. during my quest for a pedal that had the feel i wanted i sat behind a pacific drum kit that had these pedals. at first i ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hi-hat. i liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when i decided to see what it was like playing double. wow - it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities.this pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable, especially cam rotation, spring tension, and beater offset. most of the adjustments require a hex wrench, which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals. the left side slave pedal has a full floorplate, and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle i have tried. there is a slight lag on the left pedal, which is normal for any double pedal configuration, but you'll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal.before i purchased this particular model i tried out tama's iron cobra, pearl's powershifter and a gilbralter avenger. i did not like the stiffness of the iron cobra, but did like the pearl and gibraltar pedals. it finally came down to either this or the gibralter, which was slightly smoother, but significantly more expensive. i opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedal.if you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration i strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look. more importantly, try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models - selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price, features and quality. it has to feel right. in addition, you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi-hat, which means that you will need to compensate. for that i recommend the gibraltar hi-hat drop clutch (asin b0002f73yy), which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi-hat with ease. i have my hi-hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position, but stepping on the hi-hat pedal - using the clutch - puts it in full play position. tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again. this clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal!

Review: first off, this is a great, classic pedal that has shaped the tones of rock and blues artists all over the musical map. it's actually a reissue of the pedals ibanez made in the 1980's, though there's some debate over whether or not the modern circuitry retains all of that original tone. in my opinion, unless you're being purposefully picky or have the most elite of trained ears, you would never be able to tell the difference. the construction is sturdy (metal and actually heavier-feeling than a boss pedal). the led light, for some reason, is difficult to see from an angle, but that's largely an irrelevant gripe.but let's be clear what a \"tube overdrive\" pedal is and isn't. this is not a distortion petal like the boss ds-1 or metal zone (mt-2). it is also not a \"fuzz\" pedal like you would hear on a jimi hendrix song. it is not meant for heavy rock/metal/grunge type music. if you need heavy distortion to mask sloppy playing, the ts9 is not for you.what it does do, however, is to boost the signal at the front end, which essentially results in a more dynamic done with additional gain. this can result in a very midrange-heavy \"blues\" tone (stevie ray vaughan used it quite a bit), or even a nice \"crunch\" overdrive tone (ac/dc) for rhythm work. some guitars use it simply to boost their signal without adding a bunch of additional gain. it also works well with other distortion pedals for that purpose.long story short - the ibanez ts9 tubescreamer really is one of the more versatile pedals you will use - just don't expect it to create every range of sounds you need right out of the box. for a cheaper alternative, consider digitech's surprisingly good \"bad monkey\" overdrive pedal, which is half the price and gives you more control over tone. i've also compared this to boss's bd-2 blues driver, which is an excellent, but very different style of overdrive. (the bd-2 has a much hotter output and is more aggressive; the tubescreamer is more subtle and works in the midrange while retaining your underlying clean tone and responding to picking style). if you start with a good amp and guitar setup, the tubescreamer will sound great. it won't completely transform your tone, but it will give your current tones a boost, make those solos really sing and those rhythm chords really crunch.

Review: i've owned a ts808 since i purchased it used in the 80s for around $20. yes, this is a great overdrive. this pedal has many famous users and it has been used on many iconic recordings. pair this with a strat and run it into an amp on the verge of breakup - now you're in tone heaven. but the plain truth is this: there are tons of pedals out there now that do what this does - and they do it for a fraction of the cost of the 808 reissue. this was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives. i own a boatload of other dirt boxes and while this one is iconic it's not the most transparent or versatile. there is a 'mid hump' in the eq of this pedal that either sits well with what you are playing or it doesn't. i'm glad i own mine but i don't think i'd shell out what they are charging these days for the reissue. if i am not mistaken both the ts9 and the ts7 can be modded to this circuit with less than 25 cents in parts and about 15 minutes of your time. if this pedal came in under the $100 mark it would be more deserving of five stars. i really hate to burst anyone's bubble but srv's tone was really in his fingers. and so is yours ;)

Review: years ago i owned an original edition ts808; i loved that pedal and used it for years on stage. eventually i sold it many years later, but i always missed that pedal, so i decided to give this reissue a try. my verdict: awesome - it sounds just like i remember. the ts808 just has that 'certain something' that really brings out a nice smooth overdrive sound, especially when it's to enhance the overdrive sound you may already have.

Review: i have only used one of these with a hybrid tube amp and a solid state but i hear that it will work with either tube or solid state amplifiers. it really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound. this pedal can be used to boost your guitar sound during solos or certain guitar parts. this pedal has three preamp settings: ts9, hot, +, and turbo. it's great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar. one nice thing about this is it responds well to how soft or hard you pluck the strings. for example: if you set on the \"turbo\" setting and pick with your fingers it will clean up nicely. if you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound. if you want a metal sound, then i recommend the metal zone by boss/roland.boss mt-2 metal zone overdrive distortion pedal

Review: if you need a tube screamer. you can't go wrong with the ts808. the only reason why you shouldn't get it, is if it isn't the right tone for you. i say this because you can't say anything bad about this pedal. it sounds amazing. it just might not be your sound. i personally went with the ts808 because it compliments my amp better than the ts9. people who say this is better than the ts9 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording. they prefer it. it's not better. both are great.

Review: to start, as the full name of this pedal would indicate, this pedal is for tube amps. i can't comment on how it'll sound for a hybrid, and my experience is that it's definitely not for solid state. distortion pedals go much better with solid state. further, tube screamers aren't meant to take your tube amp from clean to high gain; again, that's what a distortion pedal will do. tube screamers in general are designed to drive your tubes a little harder,and are most commonly used as a solo boost. tube screamers are in the category of \"overdrive\" pedals, and like the name would indicate, they're meant add a little extra \"over\" an already \"driven\" amp, but in a more natural, smooth, organic way then a distortion pedal would.however, the ibanez ts-9dx does more than your typical tube screamer. the extra knob that switches between ts9, +, hot, and turbo mode adds a whole lot of tone and use options. let me expound:i play hard rock and metal through a bugera 1990 head (basically a marshall jcm 900)and cab with celestion vintage 30 speakers. while that amp does have a fair amount of gain and bass on tap, it's not quite enough to accurately get more modern tones unaided. a standard ibanez ts-9 or some other knock-off tube screamer will not be able to get an amp like mine into more modern, heavier tones, because standard tube screamers also slightly cut bass and add some mids, again, to help solos cut through the mix. but the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem. by switching to +, hot, or turbo mode, the pedal adds bass and a little extra gain incrementally. i like the \"+\" setting the best. so the way i use this pedal is that i'll set my amp for my standard crunchy rhythm tone with the gain on the amp already fairly high. then, for the songs that utilize a little heavier sound, i'll kick on my ts9dx, with the drive pretty low (9 o'clock), volume at 12 o'clock, tone about 1 o'clock, and + mode. with these settings it increases the bass and general thickness of my tone, and adds a little gain and volume. so it's basically like adding another channel to my amp.i will add one detail that might make or break this pedal for you: tubescreamers in general, and certainly this ibanez ts-9dx, add mid-range to your tone automatically. and you can't dial it out. the regular ts-9 mode adds some low mids, and a little more high mids. the other modes add more low mids in particular, which in part contribute to the overall \"thickness\" to the tone, which can be great. but if you're after a scooped mid sound, say for metal, then i would only recommend this pedal as a solo boost, where the mids will help cut through the mix.in conclusion, it's probably safe to say that most people who buy tubescreamers are probably playing blues of some sort and are just looking to boost their volume and maybe add a little dirt. and yes, this pedal will do that. so will the bbe greenscreamer, behringer tube overdrive,mxr distortion plus, boss sd-1, digitech bad monkey, or several other ibanez tube screamer pedal variations. but by adding the turbo-mode options, the ibanez ts-9dx will work for the hard rock and metal players (depending on the exact style) in a way that these plethora of other options won't.

Review: i am a tone freak. i bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff. at the time i had never owned a big muff. i thought the sound it produced was big muff sound. i later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff. the difference was huge. the big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box. i later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging. i am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal. i would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space

Review: consider the distortion sound of cream, the doors, and zz top. that buzzy, psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does. unfortunately, that's about all it does. however, if you want to have the perfect \"break on through\" guitar intro sound, this is absolutely the pedal for you. quality-wise it's awesome, and if i needed that sound i would definitely own one again. i got rid of mine to purchase some other gear that served a wider variety of functions, and honestly i haven't missed it, because i'm not in a doors cover band or anything.

Review: if you're not familiar with ehx's signature distortion/fuzz pedal the big muff, please go to a guitar shop somewhere and try one out. describing its sound with words helps, but doesn't really do it justice. it definitely owns its own sonic territory and after playing through one for a while you'll see why so many guitarists of so many fields have one on hand.they're one of my very favorite effects, honestly. so for this review, i'm going to focus more on how the little big muff stacks up against the other models.for starters, this version takes care of all of the common complaints regarding the nyc reissue.1. its true bypass.2. its much smaller (not super tiny like a boss, but a little slimmer than, say, the wider mxr pedals like the phase 100).3. it uses a normal 9v adapter jack (thank you, finally!).4. it sounds better.yes, it indeed sounds better than the ny reissue. some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has. this one is smoother. not as creamy as the russians, but it also doesn't suck tone like that one does either. its a touch higher gain than both the russians and the tone wicker versions, but all in all it absolutely is a big muff.so if you're in the market for one of these, and you don't want the options the tone wicker muff provides, this is absolutely where its at. its better in every way than the ny reissue.also, it costs less money! yay!

Review: the little big muff does one thing spectacularly well: it delivers massive fuzz-plus-sustain. for that purpose, it's excellent, both in sound and construction (it feels like a metal brick). however, be warned: if you're looking for a standard \"distortion pedal,\" this is not it. it's a fuzz pedal. it delivers ferocious fuzz but is not a general purpose distortion pedal (like, say, a boss ds-1). if a great fuzz pedal is what you want, this is a superb choice--and, so far as i know, the best one for its price. if the price is still too much for you, consider the modtone fuzzer, which is about as good but substantially cheaper (at least as i write this).

Review: i own several electro-harmonix pedals and overall i like the brand (even though the owner appears to me to be a sexist pig clown boy in many of his youtube videos). of those i own, two of them are the smaller versions of the gigantor classic e-h pedals, one of them being the little big muff.first of all, if you have no idea of the difference between fuzz, overdrive, and distortion you should look into it before you buy anything. these effects are used in different musical styles and produce different sounds, so your choice will depend on what exactly you plan to do. do some research by looking on youtube, looking at dave hunter's book on effects, and testing them out at a store.if you are looking for a basic fuzz box, the little big muff will give you nice sound similar to (if not the same) as that of the big muff pi, depending on the exact year/model you have. i think the tone is great, but as with most basic fuzz boxes, there are only so many different sounds that you can get out of them. it is simple to use though, and it makes a lot of noise.as a bonus, these don't take up a lot of pedalboard space compared to the big muff pi, yet will give the same tone. it is great for punk, alt rock/grunge, and classic hard rock like hendrix and black sabbath.i also have a germanium (red) dunlop fuzz face mini, another good small version of one of the classics, and the fuzz face mini that gives you the most low end emphasis of the three (the blue silicon and aqua hendrix models boost treble more). to quickly compare it to the little big muff regarding sound, the fuzz face does not have a tone control, but i think it gives a better control over the fuzz saturation. while the little big muff will give you more control over the tone (eq), like many ehx pedals it goes from zero to crazy rather quickly. in this case when you begin turning the sustain, it is not long before you are in very fuzz saturated zone. as you increase the amount of saturation, you get more sustain but less control of the dynamics so all your pick attacks begin to sound the same. so, i'd say while both the red dunlop fuzz face mini & the little big muff are good tools, each comes with its own disadvantages.though some e-h units come with power supply, this one does not and you will need to get one unless you like changing batteries. although few pedals come with power supplies, i think its lame not to include them and you will need to factor it into the cost of the unit.if you are into looking at pretty pedals on your board, then you might be able to find a prettier fuzz box than the stark and dreary industrial-looking little big muff. i like pretty things, but the sound of this unit is too good to pass up and it is a great tool to have in your kit.bottom line:(1) gives the classic big muff fuzz sound(2) does not eat up pedalboard space like the old gigantor models(3) noisy (not always in a good way) when on, but has true bypass when off(4) has tone control (eq), but the \"sustain\" saturates very quickly so you get less fuzz control (limits dynamic control of your picking)(4) simple to use, but limited sound palette(5) decent price, but power supply sold separately(6) bleak appearance (not shiny, colorful, or sparkly)

Review: this is an interesting, limited effect pedal. i bought it mainly to use with my (non-pedal) steel guitar. on a pedal steel you can bend notes with the pedals and levers, and most steel players use a volume pedal to do swells. however, i play standing up and manipulating the volume pedal was difficult to control because of balancing on one foot and the sensitivity of some of the pedals.this pedal gives a simulation of the volume swells that give steel guitar that distinctive sound. it's sort of like an automatic wah in the way it works. since the steel is always being played by picking the individual strings (no chording), this pedal works along with that technique. i combine it with a sustainer to make the swells extend a little, and it gives a fair approximation of using a volume pedal to swell the notes.i tried this with regular guitar, but it's not the same. for chords, it does add an effect, but it's not very distinctive, and for single notes, it would depend on the song. i haven't really found many instances where it's useful there either, as i normally don't want volume swells for solos on guitar, but on steel guitar, it works very well.

Review: it's a cool pedal, especially considering it's price, but don't be fooled. all this pedal does is perform volume swells. any other sound you are able to create with this pedal, you wouldn't just be using this pedal. think of it as a supplumentary effect. if you want to really get cool sounds with this pedal, you need to use it in combination with other effects; reverse delay, wah, distortion, etc.it's convenient too, if you are playing and you want use volume swells, but you also want to use other effects like wah, whammy, something else that requires the attention of your feet. if you get the settings right you can just click this effect on and it will take care of the swells. i would say thats probably the best part about the pedal and the biggest reason to get it. pure convenience.it has it's quirks though, if you set the sensitivity all the way at minimum it drastically cuts down your sustain. to the point where its non-existent. but the purpose of having the dial set like that is so that you can play loud and fast and still have the effect behave properly. if sensitivity is increased to say halfway and you try to play loud and fast, the volume effect will only occur on the first note struck... the rest will just play as if the effect was off.other than that, its built well, doesnt add any hiss. no noticeable signal loss, other than if the sensitivity is at min. the battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure. power adapters are your friend.it's cheap, its convenient. but i wouldn't recommend it for someone who is more into metal or fast and loud styles of play because that pretty much renders this pedal useless... especially since that style usually results in moments where you want to hit and sustain a note in the middle of playing hard and fast... that type of thing will make this pedal a useless hunk of plastic and circuitry. oh that reminds me, the casing is plastic...:-/

Review: i bought this effect because i saw a few youtube demos that made it look pretty good. i had always wanted an attack delay effect and the behringer slow motion was priced well below all competitors. when it arrived, i tested it thoroughly and found that it is tricky to learn and limited in scope. it only works well under these circumstances: all notes must be played slowly, individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in. you can't play a quick series of notes and expect the effect to work properly. having said that, i found that the effect is nice, once you have mastered the technique. i tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all. other reviewers have suggested using it with a digital or analog delay pedal, which i have not tried. i considered returning the unit to amazon for a refund, but i don't think that would be fair as it does work to some extent and it didn't cost me a lot of money in the first place. however, i do not think i would recommend it to a friend.

Review: s in youtube. not to mention the bargain basement price.the three modes can be accessed via a switch on the right side of this pedal. the two fuzz modes (in my view) don't perfectly emulate any one pedal, but are extremely useful nonetheless.fuzz 1 is a creamy, midrange filled sound. it doesn't get too bright, until the treble knob is pushed past 3 o' clock. this fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick. with humbuckers, it's actually quite clean in silences until the gain is past about 2 o' clock. i love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay. it seems to work best with power chords (root-5th note), and single notes. if you play complex chords, you'll hardly notice them; if you try to play them, use as little gain as possible.fuzz 2 is more in line with the big muff. it has a scooped midrange, which makes things sound dark and sinister. with the increased bass and treble, complex chords work slightly better here. this fuzz also has more sustain than fuzz 1, so it buzzes longer. this makes it great to use alongside a guitarist that's using a looser sounding high gain tone that isn't necessarily fuzzy. (head era korn comes to mind for me...)the third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile. boost. this mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level. it actually distorts a little, but that's only after cranking the eq and gain knobs all the way up. the resulting buzz does sound a bit like a slightly overdriven non-master volume amp (or a master volume's clean channel fully cranked). still, throughout most of its gain and volume range, boost does a good job of staying clean. this would be great for pushing an amp into overdrive, or extending the gain of a heavily distorted sound. it might also be useful for a tiny volume boost for cleaner guitar tones, or just to maintain a stronger signal for a path full of effects.overall, i like the tones this pedal spits out. i've only had it a few hours, but i love what i'm hearing so far. the build is similar to the other behringer pedals i have, a nr100 noise reducer, and a to800, their overdrive that sounds like a tube screamer. with this more recent pedal (built on june of 2010), the knobs seem slightly sturdier than before. i'd still not abuse them too much, though. as always, really abusive stompers might want to look elsewhere (or find a way to put the guts inside a custom built tank).you can't go wrong with the bright blue led, either! makes it easy to see on a dark stage, along with the dayglo orange pedal color.

Review: nice features on a pedal this cheap. i like the capacity to independently control treble and bass. switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal. not the bulletproof construction of a boss pedal, but i have quite a few behringer pedals and i've yet to have a malfunction in more than a year. i have an eh big muff, and this pedal is closer to that than to a dunlop fuzz face. for this price, it's another great tool for your arsenal. one thing to keep in mind with any pedal that is not true bypass - if you string a bunch of them together, you are going to experience the dreaded 'tone suck'. if most of your pedals are true bypass or have a high quality buffered bypass, you will be fine.

Review: i'm an acoustic player, but every once in a while i break out the strat just to have some fun and get a little variety. i wanted to get some of the cool 70s fuzz going just to play around and experiment. for me, this pedal was a great way to do that.with electric guitar, i'm not a tone freak and i don't need everything to sound 100% authentic. for me, this pedal gets you 80% of the way there. it has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls.if you're comparing this to $80 boss fuzz pedal, this one is probaly a lower build quality (e.g. made from plastic), but it's also only $25. i'm not taking it gigging or stomping on it in my garage, so i'll gladly take the savings.

Review: my hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder. the gel is pretty dense, so it's kind of hard and squishy and very heavy! i found that it just added more weight. i'm not using it. i would look elswhere for a different product.

Review: this strap is very comfortable! love how it just velcros right over my strap without having to remove it from guitar. it does slide around some and has to be adjusted every time i put it on but is so worth the final result.

Review: very big, very cushioned. i didn't notice that it helped all that much with the weight of my bass, but helped a little. almost thought it was a little too cumbersome, kind of bit into my neck a little.

Review: this strap is cool, it is black, made of nice material with gel padding, and it velcros open and closed so that you can just take it on and off a guitar strap without undoing the strap from the person or the guitar. like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and velcros. where i once noticed pressure and chaffing from my nylon strap, now i feel nothing but a heavy pad which puts no pressure on me whatsoever. adds about 2 lbs to the weight of your guitar. get it if your strap isn't feeling good, other brands work too but you have to thread it through the strap which suckssss. this one is legit.

Review: i love the tone! do your research though! plenty of distortion, plenty of bass and treble, makes my tubescreamers sound like a band pass filter!
